No! It’s actually that he wants to leave the possibility of “I can do it if I try” open, by not committing to anything. He doesn’t want to expose his work to criticism, and he certainly doesn’t want to face the reality that he might produce an inferior piece of writing and face rejection. He wants to live inside that realm of possibilities, where he can say that he could do it if he only had the time, or that he could write if he just had the proper environment, and that he really does have the talent for it.

Đấy là một chính sách đã được cân nhắc kĩ: giữ ngay cả các nhóm đặc quyền đặc lợi trong vòng nghèo túng vì sự khốn khó chung sẽ làm cho những ưu đãi nhỏ trở thành quan trọng và như vậy càng làm tăng khoảng cách giữa các nhóm với nhau.",

People are simply skeptical about whether other people's experiences apply to them. This is a form of egocentrism akin to the myside processing which I have discussed. Gilbert captures the irony of people's reluctance to adopt the surrogate strategy by telling his readers: \"If you are like most people, then like most people, you don't know you're like most people\" (2oo6, p. 229).",

All these things give him the same emotions. If they wax or prosper, he feels triumphant; if they dwindle and die away, he feels cast down.”26 The importance of this passage is its emphasis that economic rights are no less fundamental than civil rights and civil liberties. It makes no sense to say that I own my religious and political opinions and have a right to them but I don’t own my labor and have a right to the fruits of it. As James explains, we are equally attached to what we possess as to who we are—in fact, we define ourselves in extended form to include the home we have built, the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the books we have written and the things we have made.",

Small states have fewer congressional representatives than large ones, in proportion to size, but all states, small and large, have two senators apiece, creating a parity among states in that branch of the legislature. What does all this mean? It means that America was designed to foster a spirit of freedom and enterprise among its people, and to thwart majority rule from tyrannizing over that spirit.

(This was in 1974, when $20 could in fact buy drinks for four people.) Then Friedman cuts to the chase. “But suppose you do not. Would the other three be justified in joining forces and compelling you to share the $20 equally with them?”44 This is a crushing example, because it reflects the tyrannical logic of democratic socialism. Friedman’s point is that it would be wrong for the others to use their majority power to confiscate your newfound $20. He concludes that even if your “lucky winnings” were in some respect considered unjust, it would be more unjust to force you to give them up to produce another distribution favored by someone else.",

If you imagine all human relations as exchange, then insofar as people do have ongoing relations with one another, those relations are laced with debt and sin. The only way out is to annihilate the debt, but then social relations vanish too. This is quite in accord with Buddhism, whose ultimate aim is indeed the attainment of “emptiness,” absolute liberation, the annihilation of all human and material attachments, since these are all ultimately causes of suffering. For Mahayana Buddhists, however, absolute liberation cannot be achieved by any one being independently; the liberation of each depends on all the others; therefore, until the end of time, such matters are in a certain sense always in suspension.",

Because there are things that do. This would explain, for instance, the odd urge to first quantify the exact amount of milk one has absorbed at one’s mother’s breast, and then to say that there is no conceivable way to repay it. Exchange implies interaction between equivalent beings. Your mother, on the other hand, is not an equivalent being. She created you out of her own flesh. This is exactly the point that I suggested the Vedic authors were subtly trying to make when they talked about “debts” to the gods: of course you cannot really “pay your debt to the universe”—that would imply that (1) you and (2) everything that exists (including you) are in some sense equivalent entities. This is clearly absurd. The closest you can come to repayment is to simply recognize that fact. Such recognition is the true meaning of sacrifice. Like Rospabé’s original money, a sacrificial offering is not a way to pay a debt, but a way to acknowledge the impossibility of the idea that there could ever be repayment:",

The immediate effect of Nixon’s unpegging the dollar was to cause the price of gold to skyrocket; it hit a peak of $600 an ounce in 1980. This of course had the effect of causing U.S. gold reserves to increase dramatically in value. The value of the dollar, as denominated in gold, plummeted.

First, there was a limit to how far central banks could reduce the interest rate: zero. But more important, Keynes believed, economists had created “an optical illusion” for themselves around banking. Commercial bankers might approve loan applications, and central bankers might set interest rates, but bankers did not ultimately control investment. There is no “nexus which unites decisions to abstain from present consumption with decisions to provide for future consumption; whereas the motives which determine the latter are not linked in any simple way with the motives which determine the former.”35 Investment was driven not by banks but by firms making the decision to upgrade equipment or devote resources to new research. Workers didn’t decide to save or spend based on sophisticated considerations about maximizing the utility of their money over the course of several years; they saved when they could afford to save, not when interest rates reached an attractively high level. Particularly during hard times, people exhibited a powerful “liquidity preference”—the desire to hold cash on hand rather than tie up their money in investment vehicles. Even bankers, eyeing the economic landscape, could be reluctant to approve longer-term loans, instead opting to either hold on to cash or devote it to quick projects that would return the money fast. Titans of industry, surveying a world of depression, would be cautious about dumping money into new projects that would take years to pay off. Interest rates didn’t find the equilibrium between savings and investment; they just measured the price at which people were willing to forgo the convenience or certainty of cash.",

If governments refused to build, however, any activity that directly enhanced the purchasing power of the public would probably help. By putting money in the hands of workers by hiring the unemployed, reducing their taxes, or offering other direct material benefits, governments could increase the aggregate demand in society. When an economy faced an excess of supply, the normal business response would be to cut production, creating unemployment. To prevent that outcome, a government could boost demand, allowing businesses to maintain high levels of production by enabling consumers to buy more products. With more money in their pockets, citizens could buy more goods. Businessmen and investors, seeing those encouraging signs, would get their confidence back, resume taking the risks necessary for economic growth, and put money behind useful projects. This was the way out of the Depression.",

But crucially, rising prices created the expectation of higher prices—and that could lead to a vicious inflationary cycle. The belief that prices would go up would cause retailers to charge more and inspire labor unions to demand pay raises. When those increases were realized, they would again generate expectations of further price hikes. Inflation could take on a life of its own, even when policy makers least expected it.

Despite the Fed’s efforts, prices began to creep up in 1968 and accelerated in 1969.

In such cases, short-run productive capabilities are enhanced, as the TNC subsidiary replacing the (current and future) national firms is usually more productive than the latter.

Negotiated transfers of power both maintained the fundamental social structure the dictatorships were set up to protect and provided impunity for the rulers, who remained wealthy and influential. The elites who felt threatened by social movements in the 1950s and ’60s remained in charge, and the countries were well integrated into the global capitalist system. This was now the case in almost every country in Latin America, and the vast majority of Southeast Asia.

It’s hard, and requires self-control. But it creates a gap between what you could do and what you choose to do that accrues to you over time.

We see the homes they bought, not the homes they could have bought had they stretched themselves thin. The danger here is that I think most people, deep down, want to be wealthy. They want freedom and flexibility, which is what financial assets not yet spent can give you.

If you have flexibility you can wait for good opportunities, both in your career and for your investments. You’ll have a better chance of being able to learn a new skill when it’s necessary. You’ll feel less urgency to chase competitors who can do things you can’t, and have more leeway to find your passion and your niche at your own pace. You can find a new routine, a slower pace, and think about life with a different set of assumptions. The ability to do those things when most others can’t is one of the few things that will set you apart in a world where intelligence is no longer a sustainable advantage.",

Modern jets have four redundant electrical systems. You can fly with one engine and technically land with none, as every jet must be capable of stopping on a runway with its brakes alone, without thrust reverse from its engines. Suspension bridges can similarly lose many of their cables without falling. The biggest single point of failure with money is a sole reliance on a paycheck to fund short-term spending needs, with no savings to create a gap between what you think your expenses are and what they might be in the future.",

They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land.

The farmers would use the money the Kadoories loaned them to grow and sell their products, then pay back the loan with some of their profits or in seeds or food.

An entire class period could be just one problem with many parts. When a student offered an idea for how to approach a problem, rather than engaging in multiple choice, the teacher had them come to the board and put a magnet with their name on it next to the idea. By the end of class, one problem on a blackboard the size of an entire wall served as a captain’s log of the class’s collective intellectual voyage, dead ends and all. Richland originally tried to label the videotaped lessons with a single topic of the day, “but we couldn’t do it with Japan,” she said, “because you could engage with these problems using so much different content.” (There is a specific Japanese word to describe chalkboard writing that tracks conceptual connections over the course of collective problem solving: bansho.)",

The trend did not hold for solo climbers, only teams, and the researchers argued that hierarchical teams benefitted from a clear chain of command, but suffered from a one-way chain of communication that obscured problems. The teams needed elements of both hierarchy and individualism to both excel and survive.",

On top of this was the next layer of “status,” positing that “social media in its original construct is really about status, showing people that you are cool, getting likes and comments.” He reasoned that “status” was less accessible, holding a narrower base of appeal and a limited frequency of engagement given “people only do things that are cool once a week or once a month and not every day.” The final pyramid layer was termed “talent.” Talent based content was more interesting than status-based content. It consisted of people creating media to entertain others. Producing this content took time and creativity. Fewer people were willing to learn a new dance or patiently shoot a music video. TikTok is primarily an entertainment platform. The ‘social’ aspect is relatively weak to the point of being almost non-existent for most users beyond reading, writing, and liking strangers’ comments, similar to how most use YouTube.

The rub, of course, is that you aren’t told those odds in advance: until you start playing, you won’t have any idea which machines are the most lucrative (“loose,” as slot-machine aficionados call it) and which ones are just money sinks. Naturally, you’re interested in maximizing your total winnings.

Peter, states that “every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.” The idea is that in a hierarchical organization, anyone doing a job proficiently will be rewarded with a promotion into a new job that may involve more complex and/or different challenges. When the employee finally reaches a role in which they don’t perform well, their march up the ranks will stall, and they will remain in that role for the rest of their career. Thus it stands to reason, goes the ominous logic of the Peter Principle, that eventually every spot in an organization will come to be filled by someone doing that job badly. Some fifty years before Peter’s formulation, Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset in 1910 voiced the same sentiment. “Every public servant should be demoted to the immediately lower rank,” he wrote, “because they were advanced until they became incompetent.”",

This sounds like a reasonable approach to getting more employees to take vacation, but from a game-theoretic perspective it’s actually misguided. Increasing the cash on the table in the prisoner’s dilemma, for instance, misses the point: the change doesn’t do anything to alter the bad equilibrium. If a million-dollar heist ends up with both thieves in jail, so does a ten-million-dollar heist. The problem isn’t that vacations aren’t attractive; the problem is that everyone wants to take slightly less vacation than their peers, producing a game whose only equilibrium is no vacation at all. A thousand bucks sweetens the deal but doesn’t change the principle of the game—which is to take as much vacation as possible while still being perceived as slightly more loyal than the next guy or gal, therefore getting a raise or promotion over them that’s worth many thousands of dollars. Does this mean that Libin needs to offer tens of thousands of dollars per employee per vacation? No. Mechanism design tells us that Libin can get the happy employees he wants with the stick, rather than the carrot; he can get a better equilibrium without spending a dime. For instance, he could simply make a certain minimal amount of vacation compulsory. If he can’t change the race, he can still change the bottom. Mechanism design makes a powerful argument for the need for a designer—be it a CEO, a contract binding all parties, or a don who enforces omertà by garroted carotid.",

        "content": "As Robert Frank puts it, “The worry that people will leave relationships because it may later become rational for them to do so is largely erased if it is not rational assessment that binds them in the first place.” He explains: Yes, people search for objective characteristics they care about. Everybody wants somebody who’s kind and intelligent and interesting and healthy and maybe physically attractive, good earning power, the whole laundry list of features, but that’s the first pass.… After you’ve spent enough time together, it’s not those things that make you want to stay together. It’s just the fact that it’s that particular person—that is what’s valuable to you, so you don’t really need the contract so much as you need a feeling that makes you not want to separate, even though objectively there might be a better option available to you. Said differently: Love is like organized crime. It changes the structure of the marriage game so that the equilibrium becomes the outcome that works best for everybody.",

        "content": "A game-theoretic argument for love would highlight one further point: marriage is a prisoner’s dilemma in which you get to choose the person with whom you’re in cahoots. This might seem like a small change, but it potentially has a big effect on the structure of the game you’re playing. If you knew that, for some reason, your partner in crime would be miserable if you weren’t around—the kind of misery even a million dollars couldn’t cure—then you’d worry much less about them defecting and leaving you to rot in jail. So the rational argument for love is twofold: the emotions of attachment not only spare you from recursively overthinking your partner’s intentions, but by changing the payoffs actually enable a better outcome altogether. What’s more, being able to fall involuntarily in love makes you, in turn, a more attractive partner to have. Your capacity for heartbreak, for sleeping with the emotional fishes, is the very quality that makes you such a trusty accomplice.",

The second company, encouraged by this bid to take an optimistic view of their own ambiguous survey, bids even higher. The third company has a weak survey but now doesn’t trust it in light of what they take to be two independent surveys that suggest it’s a gold mine, so they make a new high bid. The fourth company, which also has a lackluster survey, is now even more strongly inclined to disregard it, as it seems like three of their competitors all think it’s a winner. So they bid too. The “consensus” unglues from reality. A cascade has formed. No single bidder has acted irrationally, yet the net result is catastrophe.

It has the veneer of kindness about it, but it does two deeply alarming things. First, it passes the cognitive buck: “Here’s a problem, you handle it.” Second, by not stating your preferences, it invites the others to simulate or imagine them. And as we have seen, the simulation of the minds of others is one of the biggest computational challenges a mind (or machine) can ever face. In such situations, computational kindness and conventional etiquette diverge. Politely withholding your preferences puts the computational problem of inferring them on the rest of the group. In contrast, politely asserting your preferences (“Personally, I’m inclined toward x. What do you think?”) helps shoulder the cognitive load of moving the group toward resolution. Alternatively, you can try to reduce, rather than maximize, the number of options that you give other people—say, offering a choice between two or three restaurants rather than ten. If each person in the group eliminates their least preferred option, that makes the task easier for everyone. And if you’re inviting somebody out to lunch, or scheduling a meeting, offering one or two concrete proposals that they can accept or decline is a good starting point. None of these actions is necessarily “polite,” but all of them can significantly lower the computational cost of interaction.",

For the same reason a college student might take all the toughest courses with the hardest-grading professors: she cared more about learning than getting top grades. “I am always trying to grow, to learn, to change,” she wrote me.17We could see that attitude in her behavior as results started coming in. She thought carefully about them and what they suggested about how she makes decisions, and often shared thoughtful, introspective e-mails with our project manager. She kept this up while her Brier score improved and it looked like she might crack the top ranks. And she kept at it when some of her high-confidence forecasts ended badly and her accuracy plunged. Question after question, month after month, she kept at it. That’s grit. It’s also why I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see her ultimately become a superforecaster.",

A very different way is to beat competitors by forecasting more accurately—for example, correctly deciding that there is a 68% chance of something happening when others foresee only a 60% chance.

[W]hat are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years?” This set of questions triggers mental time travel that cues that accountability conversation (also encouraged by a truthseeking decision group). We can build on Welch’s tool by asking the questions through the frame of the past: “How would I feel today if I had made this decision ten minutes ago? Ten months ago? Ten years ago?” Whichever frame we choose, we draw on our past experiences (including similar decisions we may have regretted) in answering the questions, recruiting into the decision those less-reactive brain pathways that control executive functioning.",

We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approval of our constituents.

After all, we tell ourselves, we can always go back to basic cable or downgrade to the “silver package.” But once we try the gold package, of course, we claim ownership of it. Will we really have the strength to downgrade back to basic or even to “digital silver”? Doubtful. At the onset, we may think that we can easily return to the basic service, but once we are comfortable with the digital picture, we begin to incorporate our ownership of it into our view of the world and ourselves, and quickly rationalize away the additional price. More than that, our aversion to loss—the loss of that nice crisp “gold package” picture and the extra channels—is too much for us to bear. In other words, before we make the switch we may not be certain that the cost of the digital gold package is worth the full price; but once we have it, the emotions of ownership come welling up, to tell us that the loss of “digital gold” is more painful than spending a few more dollars a month.

What was the outcome? Over the next few years, as the employees received raises, the saving rates increased from about 3.5 percent to around 13.5 percent—a gain for the employees, their families, and the company, which by now had more satisfied and less worried employees. This is the basic idea of free lunches—providing benefits for all the parties involved. Note that these free lunches don’t have to be without cost (implementing the self-control credit card or “save more tomorrow” inevitably involves a cost). As long as these mechanisms provide more benefits than costs, we should consider them to be free lunches—mechanisms that provide net benefits to all parties.",

But once we returned home to our beloved American families and friends, the basis for comparison switched back to “normal” mode. Given this situation, it was hard to understand why Jon or I would want to spend another evening in each other’s company rather than with those we love. My advice? Understand that relativity is everywhere, and that we view everything through its lens—rose-colored or otherwise. When you meet someone in a different country or city and it seems that you have a magical connection, realize that the enchantment might be limited to the surrounding circumstances. This realization might prevent you from subsequent disenchantment.",

Now, if everyone at the table pays $25, every person would feel some pain of paying. In order to make this less abstract, let’s assign “units” as a measure of this pain. We’ll assume that paying $25 translates into 10 units of pain for a total of 40 units of pain for the whole table when it comes time to split the bill. But what if one person pays the entire bill? Since the pain of paying does not increase linearly with the amount of payment, the person who is paying will feel 10 units of pain for the first $25 that he or she pays; maybe 7 units for the next $25; 5 units for the next $25; and 4 units for the last $25. The total of 26 units of pain lowers the amount of pain for the entire table by 14 units. The general point is this: we all love getting our meals for nothing, and as long as we can alternate payers, we can enjoy many FREE! dinners and derive greater overall benefit from our friendships in the process.",

Opinion polls such as Gallup’s are based on samples of the voting population. This means that opinion pollsters need to deal with two issues: sample error and sample bias. Sample error reflects the risk that, purely by chance, a randomly chosen sample of opinions does not reflect the true views of the population. The “margin of error” reported in opinion polls reflects this risk, and the larger the sample, the smaller the margin of error. A thousand interviews is a large enough sample for many purposes, and during the 1936 election campaign Mr. Gallup is reported to have conducted three thousand interviews. But if three thousand interviews were good, why weren’t 2.4 million far better? The answer is that sampling error has a far more dangerous friend: sampling bias. Sampling error is when a randomly chosen sample doesn’t reflect the underlying population purely by chance; sampling bias is when the sample isn’t randomly chosen at all. George Gallup took pains to find an unbiased sample because he knew that was far more important than finding a big one.",

Hong Kong’s rapid growth was partly thanks to an influx of immigrants from famine-struck communist China, but Cowperthwaite and Friedman also believed—with some reason—that it was flourishing thanks to a laissez-faire approach to policy. Cowperthwaite’s government levied low taxes and provided very little in the way of public services. The private sector, he argued, would tend to solve people’s problems more quickly and efficiently than the state. Why, then, collect data that would only encourage meddling from the authorities back in London? Cowperthwaite figured that the less London’s politicians did, the better—and the less they knew, the less they would try to do.",

Third, we should look at the labels on the data we’re being given, and ask if we understand what’s really being described. Fourth, we should look for comparisons and context, putting any claim into perspective. Fifth, we should look behind the statistics at where they came from—and what other data might have vanished into obscurity. Sixth, we should ask who is missing from the data we’re being shown, and whether our conclusions might differ if they were included. Seventh, we should ask tough questions about algorithms and the big datasets that drive them, recognizing that without intelligent openness they cannot be trusted. Eighth, we should pay more attention to the bedrock of official statistics—and the sometimes heroic statisticians who protect it. Ninth, we should look under the surface of any beautiful graph or chart. And tenth, we should keep an open mind, asking how we might be mistaken, and whether the facts have changed.",

Whatever matter is, it has little, if any, substance.”53 For this reason, German physicist Hans-Peter Dürr stated: “Matter is not made of matter.”54 Or as physicist Fritjof Capra puts it: “Atoms consist of particles and these particles are not made of any material stuff.”",

They change the game to limit your ability to back out. 3) Cut off communication. 4) Burn bridges behind you. In using these tactics, the most radical of those listed, you deny yourself any possibility of backing down. 5) Leave the outcomes to chance. 6) Move in small steps. Randomization is a way of dealing with decisions when unpredictability is the most rational approach. And a big commitment can be broken down into many smaller ones. The gain from breaking a smaller commitment may be off set by loss of remaining contact. 7) Develop credibility through teamwork.

He wrote, “War appears to be, or threatens to be, not so much a contest of strength as one of endurance, nerve, obstinacy, and pain. It appears to be, threatens to be, not so much a contest of military strength as a bargaining process—dirty, extortionate, and often quite reluctant bargaining on one side or both —nevertheless a bargaining process.”15 He sees war as a violent exchange of threats, promises, commitments, and warnings carried out as those strategies are in other circumstances, but with more devastating outcomes. Violence, pain, and destruction can threaten, deter, blackmail, or cause any number of outcomes. Total war is not a modern invention, as in ancient wars, the losing side had its women taken and sold into slavery, while the men were put to death and the young boys castrated. Cattle were slaughtered and buildings torn down, in notions of justice, revenge, custom, and personal gain. This violence is most successful when it is threatened but not used, as has often been the case in the relations between unequal powers, as Thucydides noted, “The strong do what they can, the weak suffer as they must.”",

He used a joke to introduce his point, that went: There was a small plane that had four passengers, the president of the United States, the pope, the world’s smartest man, and a hippie. When the plane was airborne, a fi re suddenly broke out, and there were only three parachutes. Disaster was imminent. The president said, “I owe it to the American people to finish my term,” and grabbed one and jumped out. The smartest man in the world declared he was an irreplaceable asset to humanity, and took another and hopped out next. The pontiff and the hippie remained looking at each other, and then the pope spoke, saying, “My son, I’m in God’s hand now. I want you to have the parachute.” The hippie replied, “Hey man, that’s really cool, really religious. But there’s no problem, there’s a parachute for each of us. The smartest man jumped out of the plane with my backpack.” Dorfman’s point was that being intelligent and educated was not any assurance of a secure future in 1982, as he reported that graduates in law, medicine, and architecture, as well as some engineers and those with MBAs would be hard pressed to find jobs. There were too many graduates for too few new positions, and not enough who had jobs were eager to leave them.3 The thermostat had switched to off on the careers he mentioned, and there was an accumulated inventory of occupants in the available positions.",

The result of this is that the percentage of lemons on the market increases. Cars that had been the average cars at first become better-than-average cars in a later market with increased lemons. That secondary market will be based on the average frequency of “lemons” in a market that no longer includes as many of the best quality used cars as had been on the earlier market.

Two common attitudes toward sunk costs are: “I have this much tied up in this already. I am not going to miss out on my chances for success by stopping now.” versus “This has already cost me much too much. I am not throwing away any more effort or money on it.” Economists generally conclude that, if possible, it is best to disregard sunk costs. They say you should just look at what the potential rewards are for future investment, that is, what will you gain versus what you will lose, regardless of how much you have already invested.",

Unfortunately, as is hinted in Raiff a’s view, this strategy rewards the irrational participant who fails to foresee the dangers, and goes ahead and plays. If, for instance, you perceive the dangers involved in the Dollar Auction, but another bidder does not, you may decline to bid after an opening bid of $.05 by the other person. Paradoxically, his ignorance will have bought him a very cheap dollar. Does this mean you should join in the bidding?",

It is as probable (unless the sides are weighted unequally) that a flip will come up heads as tails. The fact that you might flip a coin five times and it landed heads every time has no affect on the probability of what the result will be on the next toss. The probability is still 50–50.

        "content": "Keeping in mind that previous results do not alter probability can sometimes simplify more complicated problems. In many Asian cultures importance is still placed on having a male child, and the male population in fact outnumbers the female population in every age group until the superior female life span comes into play. A seemingly reasonable explanation for this, given the nearly 50–50 probability involved, is the “stopping” rule. According to this explanation, if a male child is first born, a couple stops, and has no more children. If a girl is first born, the couple has a second, hoping for a boy. This means that there will be many families with one child only—a boy, and many families with two children—a girl followed by a boy. Since there are many single sons, but few single daughters, and many families with one boy and one girl, boys will outnumber girls. However reasonable this may appear, the unalterable fact is that the probability of having a boy or a girl remains equal at every round of childbirth. Therefore, it is meaningless whether a couple stops after having a firstborn son or not. Half the first round of babies will be of each sex. For those who have a second child, half of that group will be of each sex. For those who have a third child, half of that group will be of each sex, and so on. The explanation for male children outnumbering females must lie elsewhere.",

        "content": "There are two strongly distinctive aspects of healthcare. One is that you don’t know when or whether you’ll need care—but if you do, the care can be extremely expensive. The big bucks are in triple coronary bypass surgery, not routine visits to the doctor’s office; and very, very few people can afford to pay major medical costs out of pocket. This tells you right away that healthcare can’t be sold like bread. It must be largely paid for by some kind of insurance. And this in turn means that someone other than the patient ends up making decisions about what to buy. Consumer choice is nonsense when it comes to healthcare. And you can’t just trust insurance companies either— they’re not in business for their health, or yours. This problem is made worse by the fact that actually paying for your healthcare is a loss from an insurers’ point of view—they actually refer to it as “medical costs.” This means both that insurers try to deny as many claims as possible, and that they try to avoid covering people who are actually likely to need care. Both of these strategies use a lot of resources, which is why private insurance has much higher administrative costs than single-payer systems. And since there’s a widespread sense that our fellow citizens should get the care we need—not everyone agrees, but most do—this means that private insurance basically spends a lot of money on socially destructive activities. The second thing about healthcare is that it’s complicated, and you can’t rely on experience or comparison shopping. (“I hear they’ve got a real deal on stents over at St. Mary’s!”) That’s why doctors are supposed to follow an ethical code, why we expect more from them than from bakers or grocery store owners. You could rely on a health maintenance organization to make the hard choices and do the cost management, and to some extent we do. But HMOs have been highly limited in their ability to achieve cost effectiveness because people don’t trust them—they’re profit-making institutions, and your treatment is their cost. Between those two factors, healthcare just doesn’t work as a standard market story.",

Prometheus defied the gods by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to humankind. Fire is a volatile gift, capable of creation and destruction, but humans learned to tame it, and it became the basis for civilization. As punishment for this insubordination, the gods sent a “beautiful evil,” Pandora. She was said to be the first woman, and she carried with her a jar (or, as it has been translated, a “box”). The jar contained all that is evil, disease and other terrors, “harsh toil” and “grievous sicknesses that are deadly to men.” Prometheus had warned the humans to be wary of any gifts from the gods. But they did not heed his warning, and Pandora opened her jar. In some versions of the story, Pandora can seem malevolent, deliberately unleashing a whirlwind of torment. In other tellings, she is naive, her greatest sin simply curiosity. As they sought to hide from a historic crisis of their own creation, the Sacklers could sometimes seem like Pandora, gazing, slack-jawed, at the momentous downstream consequences of their own decisions. They told the world, and themselves, that the jar was full of blessings, that it was a gift from the gods. Then they opened it, and they were wrong.",

Just because a person eats and works does not mean that he is fit. The most reliable criterion is how that persons himself feels. He can tell whether he is fit or ill.

Naturally it is simpler and easier to explain that fifteen million people are scum than to admit that you are making a mistake or have represented an idea in the wrong way. They say the people are worthless. Why worthless? I cannot measure a person’s worth in terms of his wealth or his birth, or things like that. All that means nothing, is not a measure of worth. If today I were to remove a good-for-nothing who is born wealthy I would do the nation no harm, but I would if I removed a craftsman or an intellectual who conscientiously does his duty. The value of a person depends on the value which his labour creates. It is not by his own volition that a person becomes a thinker, musician, great inventor etc. This is not the result of his individual will but rather a higher nature endows him with this disposition at birth. A person may be praised because he is a genius; his abilities are, however, of no importance if he cannot make them serve everyone. He can just as well be a brilliant criminal, good-fornothing, or as we say in Bavaria, a”Schwabinger”.",

It’s only gradually that it became transformed in this direction, with the object of maintaining the rule of the priests, who can live only to the detriment of society collectively. The instructions of a hygienic nature that most religions gave, contributed to the foundation of organized communities. The precepts ordering people to wash, to avoid certain drinks, to fast at appointed dates, to take exercise, to rise with the sun, to climb to the top of the minaret—all these were obligations invented by intelligent people. The exhortation to fight courageously is also self-explanatory. Observe, by the way, that, as a corollary, the Mussulman* was promised a paradise peopled with houris, where wine flowed in streams—a real earthly paradise. The Christians, on the other hand, declare themselves satisfied if after their death they are allowed to sing Hallelujahs! All these elements contributed to form human communities. It is to these private customs that peoples owe their present characters. Christianity, of course, has reached the peak of absurdity in this respect. And that’s why one day its structure will collapse. Science has already impregnated humanity. Consequently, the more Christianity clings to its dogmas, the quicker it will decline.",

The average human being has the same needs, but can satisfy them only by elementary means. That’s particularly true of women, as also of peasants who impotently watch the destruction of their crops. The person whose life tends to simplification is thirsty for belief, and he dimly clings to it with all his strength. Nobody has the right to deprive simple people of their childish certainties until they’ve acquired others that are more reasonable. Indeed, it’s most important that the higher belief should be well established in them before the lower belief has been removed. We must finally achieve this.

A man who asks you if you have made your will is lacking in tact. The younger one is, the less one cares about such matters. But old people cling madly to life. So it’s amongst them that the Church recruits her best customers. She entices them with the prospect that death interrupts nothing, that beyond our human term everything continues, in much more agreeable conditions. And you’d refuse to leave your little pile of savings to the Church? Grosso modo, that’s more or less how it goes. Is there a single religion that can exist without a dogma? No, for in that case it would belong to the order of science. Science cannot explain why natural objects are what they are. And that’s where religion comes in, with its comforting certainties. When incarnated in the Churches, religion always finds itself in opposition to life. So the Churches would be heading for disaster, and they know it, if they didn’t cling to a rigid truth.

The fly is snapped up by a dragonfly, which itself is swallowed by a bird, which itself falls victim to a larger bird. This last, as it grows old, becomes a prey to microbes, which end by getting the better of it. These microbes, in their turn, find their predestined ends. If we had more powerful microscopes, we would discover new worlds. In the absolute, moreover, nothing is either great or small. Things are big or little by the standard one selects. What is certain, in any case, is that one cannot change anything in all that. Even a man who takes his own life returns finally to nature—body, soul, and mind. The toad knows nothing of his previous existence as a tadpole, and our own memory serves us no better as regards our own previous state. That’s why I have the feeling that it’s useful to know the laws of nature—for that enables us to obey them. To act otherwise would be to rise in revolt against Heaven. If I can accept a divine Commandment, it’s this one: “Thou shalt preserve the species.” The life of the individual must not be set at too high a price. If the individual were important in the eyes of nature, nature would take care to preserve him. Amongst the millions of eggs a fly lays, very few are hatched out—and yet the race of flies thrives. What is important for us, who are men, is less the sum of knowledge acquired than the maintenance of conditions that enable science constantly to renew itself.",

Man, alone amongst the living creatures, tries to deny the laws of nature. The great tragedy for man is that he understands the mechanism of things, but the things themselves remain an enigma to him. We are capable of distinguishing the component parts of a molecule. But when it’s a question of explaining the why of a thing, words fail us. And that’s what leads men to conceive of the existence of a superior power. If I have an observatory built at Linz, I’ll have the following words carved on its front: “The heavens proclaim the glory of the eternal.” It’s marvelous that this is how mankind formed the idea of God.

There’s a point at which misunderstanding is bound to arise between man and wife; it’s when the husband cannot give his wife all the time she feels entitled to demand. As long as only other couples are involved, one hears women say: “I don’t understand Frau So-and-so. I wouldn’t behave like that.” But when she herself is involved, every woman is unreasonable to the same degree. One must understand this demandingness. A woman who loves her husband lives only for his sake. That’s why, in her turn, she expects her spouse to live likewise for her sake. It’s only after maternity that the woman discovers that other realities exist in life for her. The man, on the other hand, is a slave to his thoughts. The idea of his duties rules him. He necessarily has moments when he wants to throw the whole thing overboard, wife and children too. When I think of it, I realize that during the year 1932, if I’d been married, I’d scarcely have spent a few days in my own home. And even during these few days, I’d have not been my own master. The wife does not complain only of her husband’s absence. She also resents his being preoccupied, having his mind somewhere else. In a woman, the grief of separation is associated with a certain delight. After the separation, the joy of meeting again! When a sailor returns home, after a long voyage, he has something like a new marriage. After months of absence, he enjoys some weeks of complete liberty. That would never have been the case with me, and my wife would justly have been bored to death. I’d have had nothing of marriage but the sullen face of a neglected wife, or else I’d have skimped my duties. That’s why it’s better not to get married. The bad side of marriage is that it creates rights. In that case, it’s far better to have a mistress. The burden is lightened, and everything is placed on the level of a gift.",

One can imagine that, before this accident, man could live at any altitude—for the simple reason that he was not subject to the constraint of atmospheric pressure. One may also imagine that, the earth having opened, water rushed into the breach thus formed, and explosions followed, and then diluvian torrents of rain—from which human couples could escape only by taking refuge in very high regions.

Other women are extremely careful of their appearance, but not beyond the moment when they’ve found a husband. They’re obsessed by their outlines, they weigh themselves on exact scales—the least gram counts! Then you marry them, and they put on weight by the kilo! Without doubt, when we mock at women’s artifices, they could pay us back by pointing out our own coquetry—our poor, male coquetry.

It’s enough for this capitalist to entrust his money to a few well-run firms, and he’s betting on a certainty. The dividends he draws are so high that they can compensate for any loss that one of these firms might perhaps cause him. I have therefore always been opposed to incomes that are purely speculative and entail no effort on the part of those who live on them. Such gains belong by right to the nation, which alone can draw a legitimate profit from them. In this way, at least, those who create these profits—the engineers and workers—are entitled to be the beneficiaries. In my view, joint-stock companies should pass in their entirety under the control of the State. There’s nothing to prevent the latter from replacing these shares that bring in a variable interest by debentures which it guarantees and which produce a fixed interest, in a manner useful to private people who wish to invest their savings.

They’d simply have gone and gambled somewhere else, on the other side of the frontier—to the profit, that’s to say, of the French. Speaking of that, I enquired how much foreign currency the gambling at Wiesbaden might bring us in, and I told myself that even a hundred thousand marks in foreign money (it’s not much, when one has it) is quite a sum when one is poor.

In choosing a Chief of State, one must call upon a personality who, as far as human beings can judge, guarantees a certain stability in the exercise of power for a longish while. This is a necessary condition, not only so that public affairs can be successfully administered, but in order to make possible the realization of great projects. 3.

There are cases, in fact, in which the courageous decision of a single statesman can save the lives of a great number of soldiers. That’s why pessimism is a plague amongst statesmen. One should be able to weed out all the pessimists, so that at the decisive moment these men’s knowledge may not inhibit their capacity for action.",

Thanks to this, we obtained a good insight into the arguments which would be used by those sent to heckle at our meetings, and we were thus in a position to silence them the moment they opened their mouths. I dealt with the women from the Marxist camp who took part in the discussions by making them look ridiculous, by drawing attention either to the holes in their stockings or to the fact that their children were filthy. To convince women by reasoned argument is always impossible; to have had them roughly handled by the ushers of the meeting would have aroused public indignation, and so our best plan was to have recourse to ridicule, and this produced excellent results. 7. At all my meetings I always spoke extempore. I had, however, a number of Party members in the audience, with orders to interrupt along lines carefully prepared to give the impression of a spontaneous expression of public opinion, and these interruptions greatly strengthened the force of my own arguments. 8. If the police intervened, women of our Party were given the task of drawing their attention either to opponents or to completely unknown people who happened to find themselves near the entrance to the hall. In cases like this, the police invariably go about their job quite blindly, like a pack of hounds, and we found that this method was most efficacious, both for ridding ourselves of undesirable elements of the audience and for getting rid of the police themselves.",

Higher power must be achieved by increasing the number. of standard cylinders rather than by the introduction of a variety of new cylinders. The dashboard, too, must be simplified. But the most important task will be the design of one single engine which can be used just as well for a field kitchen as for an ambulance, a reconnaissance car, road-haulage or a heavy artillery tractor. The twenty-eight-horsepower engine of the Volkswagen should be able to meet all these military requirements. This war has proved that great speeds are of no particular military use, and we must get away from this craze for “performance.” Provided that the military vehicles mentioned above can attain a speed of between ten and twenty kilometers an hour, they will be perfectly adequate.",

        "content": "It is very curious that devout Christians like the British and the Americans should, despite their constant and fervent prayers, receive such a series of hidings from the pagan Japanese! It rather looks as if the real God takes no notice of the prayers offered day and night by the British and the Americans, but reserves His mercies for the heroes of Japan. It is not surprising that this should be so, for the religion of the Japanese is above all a cult of heroism, and its heroes are those who do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for the glory and safety of their country. The Christians, on the other hand, prefer to honor the Saints, that is to say, a man who succeeds in standing on one leg for years at a time, or one who prefers to lie on a bed of thorns rather than to respond to the smiles of inviting maidens. There is something very unhealthy about Christianity. Another peculiarity of the Christian faith, as it is taught by the Catholic Church, is that it is a school of pessimism rather than of optimism. The Japanese religion, on the contrary, rouses men to enthusiasm by the promise it holds of the rewards in the Hereafter, while the unfortunate Christian has no prospect before him but the torments of Hell. Such pessimism has a marked effect. Even a child of three can be made to acquire a terror of mind which will remain with him for the whole of his life. We all know many grown-up people who are nervous in the dark, simply because they had been told in their childhood that a bogeyman, a robber or the like lurked in the shadows. It is no less difficult to eradicate these childish inhibitions than it is to free the human soul of that haunting terror of Hell which the Catholic Church impresses on it with such vigor during its most tender years. A man possessed of a minimum of intelligence who takes the trouble to ponder over these questions has no difficulty in realizing how nonsensical these doctrines of the Church are. For how, he must ask himself, can a man possibly be put on a spit, be roasted and tortured in a hundred other ways when, in the nature of things, his body has no part in the resurrection? And what nonsense it is to aspire to a Heaven to which, according to the Church’s own teaching, only those have entry who have made a complete failure of life on earth! It won’t be much fun, surely, to have to meet again there all those whose stupidity, in spite of the biblical tag “blessed are the humble of heart,” has already infuriated one beyond endurance on this earth! Imagine, too, how tremendously attractive a Heaven will be to a man, which contains only women of indifferent appearance and faded intellect! Only those, we are told, with the minimum of sin shall enter through the gates of Heaven; now, in spite of the fact that the burden of sin must inevitably grow heavier with each successive year, I have yet to meet a priest anxious to leave this life as quickly, and therefore with as light a burden, as possible! But I could name many a Cardinal of sixty and over who clings most tenaciously to life on this sinful earth. When one examines the Catholic religion closely, one cannot fail to realize that it is an almost incredibly cunning mixture of hypocrisy and business acumen, which trades with consummate skill on the deeply engrained affection of mankind for the beliefs and superstitions he holds. It is inconceivable that an educated priest should really believe all the nonsense that the Church pours out; a proof there, to my mind, is the fact that the priests themselves always try to confuse the issue on the subject of the swindle of dispensations, and avoid whenever possible any discussion of the subject.",

We must concentrate on extracting from these territories everything that it is possible to extract. As an incentive to them to deliver their agricultural produce to us, and to work in our mines and armament factories, we will open shops all over the country at which they will be able to purchase such manufactured articles as they want. If we started bothering about the well-being of each individual, we should have to set up a State organization on the lines of our own State administration—and all we should achieve would be to earn the hatred of the masses. In reality, the more primitive a people is, the more it resents as an intolerable restraint any limitation of the liberty of the individual. The other great disadvantage of an organized society is, from our point of view, that it would fuse them into a single entity and would give them a cohesive power which they would use against us. As an administrative organization, the most we can concede to them is a form of communal administration, and that only in so far as it may be necessary for the maintenance of the labor potential, that is to say for the maintenance of the elementary basic needs of the individual. Even these village communities must be organized in a manner which precludes any possibility of fusion with neighboring communities; for example, we must avoid having one solitary church to satisfy the religious needs of large districts, and each village must be made into an independent sect, worshipping God in its own fashion. If some villages as a result wish to practice black magic, after the fashion of negroes or Indians, we should do nothing to hinder them.

For with the Ptolemaic theory collapsed a world upon which the whole philosophy of the Church was founded. At the time, it required great courage to declare oneself in favor of the Copernican theory and to take the consequences, for the Church defended itself without mercy. Which is understandable, of course, for the more bigoted a man or an organization is, the more shattering becomes the impact of the revelation of their errors and, with it, the destruction of the whole basis of their thought. History shows that inventors have met much the same fate. The postmaster who made the epoch-making discovery that it was possible to place a vehicle on rails and propel it by steam was, at the time, uproariously ridiculed by the postal directors—that is, by the experts. The tragedy is that it is always an inventor’s fate to attack something which is already established and which has therefore come to be regarded by the people as immutable. In addition, the initial effect of a new invention is invariably to create disorder. War, which gives added impetus to every form of activity, is therefore undoubtedly the most favorable atmosphere for invention. Aviation, for instance, made more progress in three and a half years of war than in thirty years of peace. One has only to recollect that in 1906 it was taken as axiomatic that the aeroplane was valueless unless it could attain a speed of twenty-five miles an hour.",

Otherwise, there will eventually spring up a stolid, stupid bureaucracy. And it is only by giving the regional leaders responsibility that one will obtain men eager to accept it, and thus form a nucleus from which to chose leaders for the highest posts in the State. While giving my Gauleiters and Reichstatthalters the greatest possible liberty of action, I have at the same time demanded of them the strictest possible discipline in obedience to orders from above, it being understood, of course, that the central government is not concerned with matters of detail, which vary greatly in different parts of the country. In this connection I want to lay particular emphasis on one point—namely, that there is nothing more harmful to the organization of a State than over-centralization arid limitation of local power. The lawyers among us hanker constantly for such limitation. But, as Bismarck rightly pointed out in 1871, it was centralization that had brought about the downfall of France; the petty Départements, being vested with no powers at all, were robbed of all initiative and sat dumbly awaiting instructions from Paris. I can sum up my own views by saying that one should give to local authority the widest possible powers of self-government, but should at the same time ensure strict obedience to orders from above. Wherever superior authority intervenes, its orders must be regarded as final.",

In road construction, the system was prevalent whereby the local authorities in each small locality through which the highway was to run were called upon to defray the costs of construction in the territory under their jurisdiction. With such an idea, no wonder the scheme did not achieve much! When I studied the financial aspect of the project, I came to the conclusion that a thousand kilometers of autobahn should be constructed each year and that the Central Government should contribute a milliard marks annually to finance it. One day I explained to Lloyd George how I proposed to find this money; firstly, I intended to get my labor by mobilizing all the unemployed and putting them to work, thus saving some six hundred million marks in dole payments; secondly, I intended to increase the income tax and the tax on petrol to an extent that would bring in an estimated revenue of four hundred million marks. And thus my autobahn would cost the State nothing. During our conversation that old fox Lloyd George asked me what thickness of concrete I proposed to use? The American motor highways have five or six centimeters of concrete, and Lloyd George could hardly believe me when I told him that ours would have from twenty-five to thirty centimeters. Indeed, Kempka told me later that one day Lloyd George stopped his car, pulled a tape measure out of his pocket and verified the correctness of what I had told him.",

Instead, they sought mass production by means of endless generalizations. A child who could not solve a mathematical equation, they said, would do no good in life. It is a wonder that they did not prophesy that he would come to a bad and shameful end! Have things changed much today, I wonder?

The systematic reading is real life, but when the actual reading hour (the day) has come to an end, and we have the period of recreation, we often continue idly to thumb over the leaves, and turn to a page here and there without method or connexion. We sometimes turn up a page we have already read, at others one still unknown to us, but always from the same book. Such an isolated page is, of course, not connected with a consistent reading and study of the book, yet it is not so very inferior thereto, if we note that the whole of the consistent perusal begins and ends also on the spur of the moment, and can therefore be regarded merely as a larger single page. Thus, although individual dreams are marked off from real life by the fact that they do not fit into the continuity of experience that runs constantly through life, and waking up indicates this difference, yet that very continuity of experience belongs to real life as its form, and the dream can likewise point to a continuity in itself. Now if we assume a standpoint of judgement external to both, we find no distinct difference in their nature, and are forced to concede to the poets that life is a long dream.",

A stupid person has no insight into the connexion of natural phenomena, either when they appear of their own accord or when they are intentionally controlled, in other words made to serve machines. For this reason, he readily believes in magic and miracles. A stupid man does not notice that different persons, apparently independent of one another, are in fact acting together by agreement; he is therefore easily mystified and puzzled. He does not observe the concealed motives of proffered advice, expressed opinions, and so on. But it is invariably only one thing that he lacks, namely keenness, rapidity, ease in applying the law of causality, in other words, power of the understanding. The greatest and, in this respect, the most instructive example of stupidity that I ever came across was that of a totally imbecile boy of about eleven years of age in an asylum. He certainly had the faculty of reason, for he spoke and comprehended, but in understanding he was inferior to many animals. When I came, he noticed an eye-glass which I was wearing round my neck, and in which the windows of the room and the tops of the trees beyond them were reflected.

        "content": "On the other hand, Kant’s fourfold antinomy will be shown to be a groundless piece of jugglery in the criticism of his philosophy that is appended to the present work. But the contradiction that at last necessarily presents itself to us here finds its solution in the fact that, to use Kant’s language, time, space, and causality do not belong to the thing-in-itself, but only to its appearance or phenomenon, of which they are the form. In my language, this means that the objective world, the world as representation, is not the only side of the world, but merely its external side, so to speak, and that the world has an entirely different side which is its innermost being, its kernel, the thing-in-itself. This we shall consider in the following book, calling it ‘will’ after the most immediate of its objectifications. But the world as representation, with which alone we are dealing here, certainly begins only with the opening of the first eye, and without this medium of knowledge it cannot be, and hence before this it did not exist. But without that eye, in other words, outside of knowledge, there was no before, no time. For this reason, time has no beginning, but all beginning is in time. Since, however, it is the most universal form of the knowable, to which all phenomena are adapted by means of the bond of causality, time with its whole infinity in both directions is also present in the first knowledge. The phenomenon which fills this first present must at the same time be known as causally connected with, and dependent on, a series of phenomena stretching infinitely into the past, and this past itself is just as much conditioned by this first present as, conversely, this present is by that past. Accordingly, the past, out of which the first present arises, is, like it, dependent on the knowing subject, and without this it is nothing. It happens of necessity, however, that this first present does not manifest itself as the first, in other words, as having no past for its mother, and as being the beginning of time; but rather as the consequence of the past according to the principle of being in time, just as the phenomenon filling this first present appears as the effect of previous states filling that past according to the law of causality. Anyone who likes mythological interpretations may regard the birth of Chronos (Xρóνoς), the youngest of the Titans, as the description of the moment here expressed, when time appears, although it is beginningless. As he castrates his father, the crude productions of heaven and earth cease, and the races of gods and men now occupy the scene.",

If it is the mind, if it is knowledge, that makes man lord of the earth, then no errors are harmless, still less venerable and holy. And for the consolation of those who devote their strength and life in any way or concern to the noble and difficult struggle against error, I cannot refrain from adding here that, so long as truth does not exist, error can play its game, just as owls and bats do at night. But we may sooner expect that owls and bats will drive the sun back into the east than that any truth that is known and expressed clearly and fully will again be supplanted, so that the old error may once more occupy its extensive position undisturbed.

Finally, he has an actual choice between several motives, for only in abstracto can such motives, simultaneously present in consciousness, afford knowledge with regard to themselves that the one excludes the other, and thus measure against one another their power over the will. Accordingly, the motive that prevails, in that it decides the matter, is the deliberate decision of the will, and it makes known as a sure indication the character of the will. The animal, on the contrary, is determined by the present impression; only the fear of present compulsion can restrain his desires, until at last this fear has become custom, and as such determines him; this is training. The animal feels and perceives; man, in addition, thinks and knows; both will. The animal communicates his feelings and moods by gesture and sound; man communicates thought to another, or conceals it from him, by language. Speech is the first product and the necessary instrument of his faculty of reason. Therefore in Greek and Italian speech and reason are expressed by the same word, ὁ λόγoς, il discorso.

But between the abstract concept of a mile and that of a foot, without any representation from perception of either, and without the help of number, there is no exact distinction at all corresponding to these quantities themselves. In both we think only of a spatial quantity in general, and if they are to be adequately distinguished, we must either avail ourselves of intuition or perception in space, and hence leave the sphere of abstract knowledge, or we must think the difference in numbers. If, therefore, we want to have abstract knowledge of space-relations, we must first translate them into time-relations, that is, numbers.

We therefore have almost the uncomfortable feeling that we get after a conjuring trick, and in fact most of Euclid’s proofs are remarkably like such a trick. The truth almost always comes in by the back door, since it follows per accidens from some minor circumstance. Frequently, an apagogic proof shuts all doors one after the other, and leaves open only one, through which merely for that reason we must now pass. Often, as in the theorem of Pythagoras, lines are drawn without our knowing why. It afterwards appears that they were traps, which shut unexpectedly and take prisoner the assent of the learner, who in astonishment has then to admit what remains wholly unintelligible to him in its inner connexion. This happens to such an extent that he can study the whole of Euclid throughout without gaining real insight into the laws of spatial relations, but instead of these, he learns by heart only a few of their results. This really empirical and unscientific knowledge is like that of the doctor who knows disease and remedy, but not the connexion between the two. But all this is what results when we capriciously reject the method of proof and evidence peculiar to one species of knowledge, and forcibly introduce instead of it a method that is foreign to its nature. In other respects, however, the way in which this is carried out by Euclid deserves all the admiration that for so many centuries has been bestowed on him.",

In this consciousness each one knows and at the same time is himself his own individuality according to its nature immediately, without any form, even the form of subject and object, for here knower and known coincide.

On the contrary, we shall recognize both houses as works of the will objectifying itself in the two phenomena, working in us on the basis of motives, but in the snail blindly as formative impulse directed outwards. Even in us the same will in many ways acts blindly; as in all those functions of our body which are not guided by knowledge, in all its vital and vegetative processes, digestion, circulation, secretion, growth, and reproduction. Not only the actions of the body, but the whole body itself, as was shown above, is phenomenon of the will, objectified will, concrete will. All that occurs in it must therefore occur through will, though here this will is not guided by knowledge, not determined according to motives, but acts blindly according to causes, called in this case stimuli.",

It gives only the opportunity, the occasion, for the phenomenon of that one and indivisible will which is the in-itself of all things, and whose graduated objectification is this whole visible world. Only the appearing, the becoming visible, in such a place and at such a time, is brought about by the cause, and is to that extent dependent on it, but not the whole of the phenomenon, not its inner nature. This is the will itself, to which the principle of sufficient reason has no application, and which is therefore groundless. Nothing in the world has a cause of its existence absolutely and generally, but only a cause from which it exists precisely here and now. That a stone exhibits now gravity, now rigidity, now electricity, now chemical properties, depends on causes, on external impressions, and from these is to be explained. But those properties themselves, and hence the whole of its inner being which consists of them, and consequently manifests itself in all the ways mentioned, and thus in general that the stone is such as it is, that it exists generally—all this has no ground, but is the becoming visible of the groundless will. Thus every cause is an occasional cause. We have found it in nature-without-knowledge, but it is also precisely the same where motives, and not causes or stimuli, determine the point of entry of the phenomena, and hence in the actions of animals and of human beings. For in both cases it is one and the same will that appears, extremely different in the grades of its manifestation, multiplied in their phenomena, and, in regard to them, subject to the principle of sufficient reason, but in itself free from all this. Motives do not determine man’s character, but only the phenomenon or appearance of that character, that is, the deeds and actions, the external form of the course of his life, not its inner significance and content. These proceed from the character which is the immediate phenomenon of the will, and is therefore groundless. That one man is wicked and another good does not depend on motives and external influences such as teaching and preaching; and in this sense the thing is absolutely inexplicable. But whether a wicked man shows his wickedness in petty injustices, cowardly tricks, and low villainy, practised by him in the narrow sphere of his surroundings, or as a conqueror oppresses nations, throws a world into misery and distress, and sheds the blood of millions, this is the outward form of his phenomenon or appearance, that which is inessential to it, and it depends on the circumstances in which fate has placed him, on the surroundings, on external influences, on motives. But his decision on these motives can never be explained from them; it proceeds from the will, whose phenomenon this man is. We shall speak of this in the fourth book. The way in which the character discloses its qualities can be fully compared with the way in which every body in nature-without-knowledge reveals its qualities. Water remains water with the qualities inherent in it. But whether as a calm lake it reflects its banks, or dashes in foam over rocks, or by artificial means spouts into the air in a tall jet, all this depends on external causes; the one is as natural to it as is the other. But it will always show one or the other according to the circumstances; it is equally ready for all, yet in every case it is true to its character, and always reveals that alone. So also will every human character reveal itself under all circumstances, but the phenomena proceeding from it will be in accordance with the circumstances.",

But this path is followed if, as already mentioned, it is thought that all physiological effects ought to be referred to form and combination, thus possibly to electricity, this again to chemical force, and chemical force to mechanism. The mistake of Descartes, for instance, and of all the Atomists, was of this last description. They referred the movement of heavenly bodies to the impact of a fluid, and the qualities to the connexion and form of the atoms. They endeavoured to explain all the phenomena of nature as mere phenomena of impenetrability and cohesion. Although this has been given up, the same thing is done in our day by the electrical, chemical, and mechanical physiologists who obstinately try to explain the whole of life and all the functions of the organism from the “form and combination” of its component parts.",

No victory without struggle; since the higher Idea or objectification of will can appear only by subduing the lower Ideas, it endures the opposition of these. Although these lower Ideas have been brought into subjection, they still constantly strive to reach an independent and complete expression of their inner nature. The magnet that has lifted a piece of iron keeps up a perpetual struggle with gravitation which, as the lowest objectification of the will, has a more original right to the matter of that iron. In this constant struggle, the magnet even grows stronger, since the resistance stimulates it, so to speak, to greater exertion. In the same way, every phenomenon of the will, and even that which manifests itself in the human organism, keeps up a permanent struggle against the many chemical and physical forces that, as lower Ideas, have a prior right to that matter. Thus a man’s arm falls which he held upraised for a while by overcoming gravity. Hence the comfortable feeling of health which expresses the victory of the Idea of the organism, conscious of itself, over the physical and chemical laws which originally controlled the humours of the body. Yet this comfortable feeling is so often interrupted, and in fact is always accompanied by a greater or lesser amount of discomfort, resulting from the resistance of those forces; through such discomfort the vegetative part of our life is constantly associated with a slight pain. Thus digestion depresses all the animal functions, because it claims the whole vital force for overcoming by assimilation the chemical forces of nature. Hence also generally the burden of physical life, the necessity of sleep, and ultimately of death; for at last, favoured by circumstances, those subdued forces of nature win back from the organism, wearied even by constant victory, the matter snatched from them, and attain to the unimpeded expression of their being. It can therefore be said that every organism represents the Idea of which it is the image or copy, only after deduction of that part of its force which is expended in overcoming the lower Ideas that strive with it for the matter. This seems to have been present in the mind of Jacob Boehme, when he says somewhere that all the bodies of men and animals, and even all plants, are really half dead. Now, according as the organism succeeds more or less in subduing those natural forces that express the lower grades of the will’s objectivity, it becomes the more or less perfect expression of its Idea, in other words, it stands nearer to or farther from the Ideal to which beauty in its species belongs.",

Indeed, such a world is only the copy of the will’s own inner being, but yet it is of quite a different nature, and now intervenes in the sequence of phenomena of the will. Thus their infallible certainty now comes to an end. Animals already are exposed to illusion, to deception; they, however, have merely representations from perception, no concepts, no reflection; they are therefore bound to the present, and cannot take the future into consideration. It appears as if this knowledge without reason was not in all cases sufficient for its purpose, and occasionally needed some assistance, as it were. For we have the very remarkable phenomenon that the blind working of the will and that enlightened by knowledge encroach in a most astonishing way on each other’s spheres in two kinds of phenomena. In the one case we find, amid those actions of animals that are guided by knowledge of perception and its motives, one action that is carried out without these, and hence with the necessity of the blindly operating will. I refer to the mechanical instincts; these, not guided by any motive or knowledge, have the appearance of bringing about their operations from abstract rational motives. The other case, the opposite of this, is that where, on the contrary, the light of knowledge penetrates into the workshop of the blindly operating will, and illuminates the vegetative functions of the human organism.

        "content": "In fact, absence of all aim, of all limits, belongs to the essential nature of the will in itself, which is an endless striving. This was touched on above, when centrifugal force was mentioned. It also reveals itself in the simplest form of the lowest grade of the will’s objectivity, namely gravitation, the constant striving of which we see, although a final goal for it is obviously impossible. For if, according to its will, all existing matter were united into a lump, then within this lump gravity, ever striving towards the centre, would still always struggle with impenetrability as rigidity or elasticity. Therefore the striving of matter can always be impeded only, never fulfilled or satisfied. But this is precisely the case with the striving of all the will’s phenomena. Every attained end is at the same time the beginning of a new course, and so on ad infinitum. The plant raises its phenomenon from the seed through stem and leaf to blossom and fruit, which is in turn only the beginning of a new seed, of a new individual, which once more runs through the old course, and so through endless time. Such also is the life course of the animal; procreation is its highest point, and after this has been attained, the life of the first individual quickly or slowly fades, while a new life guarantees to nature the maintenance of the species, and repeats the same phenomenon. Indeed, the constant renewal of the matter of every organism can also be regarded as the mere phenomenon of this continual pressure and change, and physiologists are now ceasing to regard such renewal as the necessary reparation of the substance consumed in movement. The possible wearing out of the machine cannot in any way be equivalent to the constant inflow through nourishment. Eternal becoming, endless flux, belong to the revelation of the essential nature of the will. Finally, the same thing is also seen in human endeavours and desires that buoy us up with the vain hope that their fulfilment is always the final goal of willing. But as soon as they are attained, they no longer look the same, and so are soon forgotten, become antiquated, and are really, although not admittedly, always laid aside as vanished illusions. It is fortunate enough when something to desire and to strive for still remains, so that the game may be kept up of the constant transition from desire to satisfaction, and from that to a fresh desire, the rapid course of which is called happiness, the slow course sorrow, and so that this game may not come to a standstill, showing itself as a fearful, life-destroying boredom, a lifeless longing without a definite object, a deadening languor. According to all this, the will always knows, when knowledge enlightens it, what it wills here and now, but never what it wills in general. Every individual act has a purpose or end; willing as a whole has no end in view. In the same way, every individual phenomenon of nature is determined by a sufficient cause as regards its appearance in such a place and at such a time, but the force manifesting itself in this phenomenon has in general no cause, for such a force is a stage of appearance of the thing-in-itself, of the groundless will. The sole self-knowledge of the will as a whole is the representation as a whole, the whole world of perception. It is the objectivity, the revelation, the mirror of the will. What it expresses in this capacity will be the subject of our further consideration.",

But now, what kind of knowledge is it that considers what continues to exist outside and independently of all relations, but which alone is really essential to the world, the true content of its phenomena, that which is subject to no change, and is therefore known with equal truth for all time, in a word, the Ideas that are the immediate and adequate objectivity of the thing-in-itself, of the will? It is art, the work of genius. It repeats the eternal Ideas apprehended through pure contemplation, the essential and abiding element in all the phenomena of the world. According to the material in which it repeats, it is sculpture, painting, poetry, or music. Its only source is knowledge of the Ideas; its sole aim is communication of this knowledge. Whilst science, following the restless and unstable stream of the fourfold forms of reasons or grounds and consequents, is with every end it attains again and again directed farther, and can never find an ultimate goal or complete satisfaction, any more than by running we can reach the point where the clouds touch the horizon; art, on the contrary, is everywhere at its goal. For it plucks the object of its contemplation from the stream of the world’s course, and holds it isolated before it. This particular thing, which in that stream was an infinitesimal part, becomes for art a representative of the whole, an equivalent of the infinitely many in space and time. It therefore pauses at this particular thing; it stops the wheel of time; for it the relations vanish; its object is only the essential, the Idea.",

In other words, genius is the ability to leave entirely out of sight our own interest, our willing, and our aims, and consequently to discard entirely our own personality for a time, in order to remain pure knowing subject, the clear eye of the world; and this not merely for moments, but with the necessary continuity and conscious thought to enable us to repeat by deliberate art what has been apprehended, and “what in wavering apparition gleams fix in its place with thoughts that stand for ever!”94 For genius to appear in an individual, it is as if a measure of the power of knowledge must have fallen to his lot far exceeding that required for the service of an individual will; and this superfluity of knowledge having become free, now becomes the subject purified of will, the clear mirror of the inner nature of the world.",

Neither the faculty of reason nor understanding can be denied to the mad, for they talk and understand, and often draw very accurate conclusions. They also, as a rule, perceive quite correctly what is present, and see the connexion between cause and effect. Visions, like the fancies of an overwrought brain, are no ordinary symptom of madness; delirium falsifies perception, madness the thoughts. For the most part, mad people do not generally err in the knowledge of what is immediately present; but their mad talk relates always to what is absent and past, and only through these to its connexion with what is present. Therefore, it seems to me that their malady specially concerns the memory. It is not, indeed, a case of memory failing them entirely, for many of them know a great deal by heart, and sometimes recognize persons whom they have not seen for a long time. Rather is it a case of the thread of memory being broken, its continuous connexion being abolished, and of the impossibility of a uniformly coherent recollection of the past. Individual scenes of the past stand out correctly, just like the individual present; but there are gaps in their recollection that they fill up with fictions. These are either always the same, and so become fixed ideas; it is then a fixed mania or melancholy; or they are different each time, momentary fancies; it is then called folly, fatuitas. This is the reason why it is so difficult to question a mad person about his previous life-history when he enters an asylum. In his memory the true is for ever mixed up with the false. Although the immediate present is correctly known, it is falsified through a fictitious connexion with an imaginary past. Mad people therefore consider themselves and others as identical with persons who live merely in their fictitious past. Many acquaintances they do not recognize at all, and, in spite of a correct representation or mental picture of the individual actually present, they have only false relations of this to what is absent.",

Thus, for instance, the dog recognizes his former master even after years, that is to say, it receives the accustomed impression at the sight of him; but the dog has no recollection of the time that has since elapsed. On the other hand, the madman always carries about in his faculty of reason a past in the abstract, but it is a false past that exists for him alone, and that either all the time or merely for the moment. The influence of this false past then prevents the use of the correctly known present which the animal makes",

The man of genius excels them only in the far higher degree and more continuous duration of this kind of knowledge. These enable him to retain that thoughtful contemplation necessary for him to repeat what is thus known in a voluntary and intentional work, such repetition being the work of art. Through this he communicates to others the Idea he has grasped. Therefore this Idea remains unchanged and the same, and hence aesthetic pleasure is essentially one and the same, whether it be called forth by a work of art, or directly by the contemplation of nature and of life. The work of art is merely a means of facilitating that knowledge in which this pleasure consists. That the Idea comes to us more easily from the work of art than directly from nature and from reality, arises solely from the fact that the artist, who knew only the Idea and not reality, clearly repeated in his work only the Idea, separated it out from reality, and omitted all disturbing contingencies. The artist lets us peer into the world through his eyes. That he has these eyes, that he knows the essential in things which lies outside all relations, is the gift of genius and is inborn; but that he is able to lend us this gift, to let us see with his eyes, is acquired, and is the technical side of art.",

Further, desiring lasts a long time, demands and requests go on to infinity; fulfilment is short and meted out sparingly. But even the final satisfaction itself is only apparent; the wish fulfilled at once makes way for a new one; the former is a known delusion, the latter a delusion not as yet known. No attained object of willing can give a satisfaction that lasts and no longer declines; but it is always like the alms thrown to a beggar, which reprieves him today so that his misery may be prolonged till tomorrow. Therefore, so long as our consciousness is filled by our will, so long as we are given up to the throng of desires with its constant hopes and fears, so long as we are the subject of willing, we never obtain lasting happiness or peace. Essentially, it is all the same whether we pursue or flee, fear harm or aspire to enjoyment; care for the constantly demanding will, no matter in what form, continually fills and moves consciousness; but without peace and calm, true well-being is absolutely impossible.",

This is why the man tormented by passions, want, or care, is so suddenly revived, cheered, and comforted by a single, free glance into nature. The storm of passions, the pressure of desire and fear, and all the miseries of willing are then at once calmed and appeased in a marvellous way. For at the moment when, torn from the will, we have given ourselves up to pure, will-less knowing, we have stepped into another world, so to speak, where everything that moves our will, and thus violently agitates us, no longer exists. This liberation of knowledge lifts us as wholly and completely above all this as do sleep and dreams. Happiness and unhappiness have vanished; we are no longer the individual; that is forgotten; we are only pure subject of knowledge.

Therefore what heat is for the will, light is for knowledge.

The position, size, and form of every part must have so necessary a relation to this stability that if it were possible to remove some part, the whole would inevitably collapse. For only by each part bearing as much as it conveniently can, and each being supported exactly where it ought to be and to exactly the necessary extent, does this play of opposition, this conflict between rigidity and gravity, that constitutes the life of the stone and the manifestations of its will, unfold itself in the most complete visibility.

Now the effect of landscape-painting proper is on the whole also of this kind; but because the Ideas manifested, as higher grades of the will’s objectivity, are more significant and suggestive, the objective side of aesthetic pleasure comes more to the front, and balances the subjective. Pure knowing as such is no longer entirely the main thing, but the known Idea, the world as representation at an important grade of the will’s objectification, operates with equal force.",

Conversely, poverty of mind, confusion and perversity of thought will clothe themselves in the most far-fetched expressions and obscure forms of speech, in order to cloak in difficult and pompous phrases small, trifling, insipid, or commonplace ideas. It is like the man who lacks the majesty of beauty, and wishes to make up for this deficiency by clothing; he attempts to cover up the insignificance or ugliness of his person under barbaric finery, tinsel, feathers, ruffles, cuffs, and mantles. Thus many an author, if compelled to translate his pompous and obscure book into its little clear content, would be as embarrassed as that man would be if he were to go about naked.",

This knowledge in them, reacting on the will, does not, like that other knowledge, furnish motives for the will, but on the contrary has become a quieter of all willing.

They are separated from them by a wide gulf, just as the society of princes is inaccessible to the common people.

The same thing, on the other hand, as representation alone, purely contemplated, or repeated through art, free from pain, presents us with a significant spectacle.

He sticks to this, and does not get tired of contemplating it, and of repeating it in his descriptions. Meanwhile, he himself bears the cost of producing that play; in other words, he himself is the will objectifying itself and remaining in constant suffering. That pure, true, and profound knowledge of the inner nature of the world now becomes for him an end in itself; at it he stops. Therefore it does not become for him a quieter of the will, as we shall see in the following book in the case of the saint who has attained resignation; it does not deliver him from life for ever, but only for a few moments.

Therefore suicide already appears to us to be a vain and therefore foolish action; when we have gone farther in our discussion, it will appear to us in an even less favourable light.",

In particular, what is bad in the character will come out more and more powerfully with time; but sometimes passions to which a man gave way in his youth are later voluntarily restrained, merely because the opposite motives have only then come into knowledge. Hence we are all innocent to begin with, and this merely means that neither we nor others know the evil of our own nature.

For by such fine tricks we deceive and flatter no one but ourselves. The reverse case to what we have mentioned can also occur. I can be misled by too great confidence in others, or by not knowing the relative value of the good things of life, or by some abstract dogma in which I have now lost faith. Thus I act less egoistically than is in accordance with my character, and in this way prepare for myself repentance of another kind. Thus repentance is always corrected knowledge of the relation of the deed to the real intention. In so far as the will reveals its Ideas in space alone, that is to say, through mere form, the matter already controlled and ruled by other Ideas, in this case natural forces, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that was striving for visibility to appear in perfect purity and distinctness, i.e., in perfect beauty. This will, revealing itself in time alone, i.e., through actions, finds an analogous hindrance in the knowledge that rarely gives it the data quite correctly; and in this way the deed does not turn out wholly and entirely in keeping with the will, and therefore leads to repentance. Thus repentance always results from corrected knowledge, not from change in the will, which is impossible. Pangs of conscience over past deeds are anything but repentance; they are pain at the knowledge of oneself in one’s own nature, in other words, as will. They rest precisely on the certainty that we always have the same will. If the will were changed, and thus the pangs of conscience were mere repentance, these would be abolished; for then the past could no longer cause any distress, as it would exhibit the manifestations of a will that was no longer that of the repentant person. We shall discuss in detail the significance of pangs of conscience later on.",

If we cannot decide to do this, but, like children at a fair, snatch at everything that fascinates us in passing, this is the perverted attempt to change the line of our path into a surface. We then run a zigzag path, wander like a will-o’-the-wisp, and arrive at nothing. Or, to use another comparison, according to Hobbes’s doctrine of law, everyone originally has a right to everything, but an exclusive right to nothing; but he can obtain an exclusive right to individual things by renouncing his right to all the rest, while the others do the same thing with regard to what was chosen by him. It is precisely the same in life, where we can follow some definite pursuit, whether it be of pleasure, honour, wealth, science, art, or virtue, seriously and successfully only when we give up all claims foreign to it, and renounce everything else. Therefore mere willing and mere ability to do are not enough of themselves, but a man must also know what he wills, and know what he can do. Only thus will he display character, and only then can he achieve anything solid. Until he reaches this, he is still without character, in spite of the natural consistency of the empirical character. Although, on the whole, he must remain true to himself and run his course drawn by his daemon, he will not describe a straight line, but a wavering and uneven one. He will hesitate, deviate, turn back, and prepare for himself repentance and pain. All this because, in great things and in small, he sees before him as much as is possible and attainable for man, and yet does not know what part of all this is alone suitable and feasible for him, or even merely capable of being enjoyed by him. Therefore he will envy many on account of a position and circumstances which yet are suitable only to their character, not to his, in which he would feel unhappy, and which he might be unable to endure. For just as a fish is happy only in water, a bird only in the air, and a mole only under the earth, so every man is happy only in an atmosphere suitable to him. For example, not everyone can breathe the atmosphere of a court. From lack of moderate insight into all this, many a man will make all kinds of abortive attempts; he will do violence to his character in particulars, and yet on the whole will have to yield to it again. What he thus laboriously attains contrary to his nature will give him no pleasure; what he learns in this way will remain dead.",

It always strives, because striving is its sole nature, to which no attained goal can put an end. Such striving is therefore incapable of final satisfaction; it can be checked only by hindrance, but in itself it goes on for ever. We saw this in the simplest of all natural phenomena, namely gravity, which does not cease to strive and press towards an extensionless central point, whose attainment would be the annihilation of itself and of matter; it would not cease, even if the whole universe were already rolled into a ball. We see it in other simple natural phenomena.

We can also transfer these names to those phenomena of the world-without-knowledge which, though weaker in degree, are identical in essence. We then see these involved in constant suffering and without any lasting happiness. For all striving springs from want or deficiency, from dissatisfaction with one’s own state or condition, and is therefore suffering so long as it is not satisfied. No satisfaction, however, is lasting; on the contrary, it is always merely the starting-point of a fresh striving. We see striving everywhere impeded in many ways, everywhere struggling and fighting, and hence always as suffering.

The human individual finds himself in endless space and time as finite, and consequently as a vanishing quantity compared with these. He is projected into them, and on account of their boundlessness has always only a relative, never an absolute, when and where of his existence; for his place and duration are finite parts of what is infinite and boundless. His real existence is only in the present, whose unimpeded flight into the past is a constant transition into death, a constant dying. For his past life, apart from its eventual consequences for the present, and also apart from the testimony regarding his will that is impressed in it, is entirely finished and done with, dead, and no longer anything. Therefore, as a matter of reason, it must be indifferent to him whether the contents of that past were pains or pleasures. But the present in his hands is constantly becoming the past; the future is quite uncertain and always short. Thus his existence, even considered from the formal side alone, is a continual rushing of the present into the dead past, a constant dying. And if we look at it also from the physical side, it is evident that, just as we know our walking to be only a constantly prevented falling, so is the life of our body only a constantly prevented dying, an ever-deferred death. Finally, the alertness and activity of our mind are also a continuously postponed boredom. Every breath we draw wards off the death that constantly impinges on us. In this way, we struggle with it every second, and again at longer intervals through every meal we eat, every sleep we take, every time we warm ourselves, and so on. Ultimately death must triumph, for by birth it has already become our lot, and it plays with its prey only for a while before swallowing it up. However, we continue our life with great interest and much solicitude as long as possible, just as we blow out a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although with the perfect certainty that it will burst.",

The naive expressions of this quality can be seen in trifles and everyday phenomena; thus, for example, they write their names up at places worth seeing which they visit, in order thus to react on, to affect the place, since it does not affect them. Further, they cannot easily just contemplate a rare and strange animal, but must excite it, tease it, play with it, just to experience action and reaction.

Thus an error and delusion are at the root of immoderate joy or pain; consequently, these two excessive strains of the mind could be avoided by insight. Every immoderate joy (exultatio, insolens laetitia) always rests on the delusion that we have found something in life that is not to be met with at all, namely permanent satisfaction of the tormenting desires or cares that constantly breed new ones. From each particular delusion of this kind we must inevitably later be brought back; and then, when it vanishes, we must pay for it with pains just as bitter as the joy caused by its entry was keen. To this extent it is exactly like a height from which we can descend again only by a fall; we should therefore avoid them; and every sudden, excessive grief is just a fall from such a height, the vanishing of such a delusion, and is thus conditioned by it.

We then have, so to speak, what we were looking for, namely something that we can denounce at any moment, instead of our own inner nature, as the source of our sufferings. Thus, although at variance with our fate, we become reconciled to our existence in return for this, since the knowledge that suffering is essential to this existence itself and that true satisfaction is impossible, is again withdrawn from us. The consequence of this last kind of development is a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant bearing of a single, great pain, and the resultant disdain for all lesser joys and sorrows. This is in consequence a worthier phenomenon than the constant hunting for ever different deceptive forms which is much more usual.",

For the doings and worries of the day, the restless mockeries of the moment, the desires and fears of the week, the mishaps of every hour, are all brought about by chance that is always bent on some mischievous trick; they are nothing but scenes from a comedy. The never-fulfilled wishes, the frustrated efforts, the hopes mercilessly blighted by fate, the unfortunate mistakes of the whole life, with increasing suffering and death at the end, always give us a tragedy. Thus, as if fate wished to add mockery to the misery of our existence, our life must contain all the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot even assert the dignity of tragic characters, but, in the broad detail of life, are inevitably the foolish characters of a comedy.",

In vain does the tortured person then call on his gods for help; he remains abandoned to his fate without mercy. But this hopeless and irretrievable state is precisely the mirror of the invincible and indomitable nature of his will, the objectivity of which is his person. An external power is little able to change or suppress this will, and any strange and unknown power is just as little able to deliver him from the miseries resulting from the life that is the phenomenon of this will. As in everything, so in the principal matter, a man is always referred back to himself. In vain does he make gods for himself, in order to get from them by prayers and flattery what can be brought about only by his own will-power. While the Old Testament made the world and man the work of a God, the New saw itself compelled to represent that God as becoming man, in order to teach that holiness and salvation from the misery of this world can come only from the world itself. It is and remains the will of man on which everything depends for him. Sannyasis, martyrs, saints of every faith and name, have voluntarily and gladly endured every torture, because the will-to-live had suppressed itself in them; and then even the slow destruction of the phenomenon of the will was welcome to them.",

For generation is only reproduction passing over to a new individual, reproduction at the second power so to speak, just as death is only excretion at the second power. By reason of all this, the genitals are the real focus of the will, and are therefore the opposite pole to the brain, the representative of knowledge, i.e., to the other side of the world, the world as representation. The genitals are the life-preserving principle assuring to time endless life. In this capacity they were worshipped by the Greeks in the phallus, and by the Hindus in the lingam, which are therefore the symbol of the affirmation of the will.

Reason recognized from this that, to diminish the suffering spread over all, as well as to distribute it as uniformly as possible, the best and only means was to spare all men the pain of suffering wrong by all men’s renouncing the pleasure to be obtained from doing wrong. This means is the State contract or the law. It is readily devised and gradually perfected by egoism which, by using the faculty of reason, proceeds methodically, and forsakes its one-sided point of view. The origin of the State and of the law, as I have here mentioned, was described by Plato in the Republic. Indeed, this origin is essentially the only one, and is determined by the nature of the case. Moreover, in no land can the State have ever had a different origin, just because this mode of origination alone, this aim, makes it into a State. But it is immaterial whether in each definite nation the condition that preceded it was that of a horde of savages independent of one another (anarchy), or that of a horde of slaves arbitrarily ruled by the stronger (despotism). In neither case did any State as yet exist; it first arises through that common agreement, and according as this agreement is more or less unalloyed with anarchy or despotism, the State is more or less perfect. Republics tend to anarchy, monarchies to despotism; the mean of constitutional monarchy, devised on this account, tends to government by factions. In order to found a perfect State, we must begin by producing beings whose nature permits them generally to sacrifice their own good to that of the public. Till then, however, something can be attained by there being one family whose welfare is quite inseparable from that of the country, so that, at any rate in the principal matters, it can never advance the one without the other. On this rest the power and advantage of hereditary monarchy.",

The great Goethe has given us a distinct and visible description of this denial of the will, brought about by great misfortune and by the despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece Faust, in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know of no other description in poetry. It is a perfect specimen of the second path, which leads to the denial of the will not, like the first, through the mere knowledge of the suffering of a whole world which one acquires voluntarily, but through the excessive pain felt in one’s own person. It is true that very many tragedies bring their violently willing heroes ultimately to this point of complete resignation, and then the will-to-live and its phenomenon usually end at the same time.

Indeed, their suffering and dying in the end become agreeable to them, for the denial of the will-to-live has made its appearance. They often decline the deliverance offered them, and die willingly, peacefully, and blissfully. The last secret of life has revealed itself to them in the excess of pain, the secret, namely, that evil and wickedness, suffering and hatred, the tormented and the tormentor, different as they may appear to knowledge that follows the principle of sufficient reason, are in themselves one, phenomenon of the one will-to-live that objectifies its conflict with itself by means of the principium individuationis.

As we have said, it is a matter of complete indifference by what myths and dogmas they account to their faculty of reason for this intuitive and immediate knowledge, and for their conversion.",

The difference, that we have described as two paths, is whether that knowledge is called forth by suffering which is merely and simply known and freely appropriated by our seeing through the principium individuationis, or by suffering immediately felt by ourselves. True salvation, deliverance from life and suffering, cannot even be imagined without complete denial of the will. Till then, everyone is nothing but this will itself, whose phenomenon is an evanescent existence, an always vain and constantly frustrated striving, and the world full of suffering as we have described it. All belong to this irrevocably and in like manner. For we found previously that life is always certain to the will-to-live, and its sole actual form is the present from which they never escape, since birth and death rule in the phenomenon.",

Just because the suicide cannot cease willing, he ceases to live; and the will affirms itself here even through the cessation of its own phenomenon, because it can no longer affirm itself otherwise. But as it was just the suffering it thus shunned which, as mortification of the will, could have led it to the denial of itself and to salvation, so in this respect the suicide is like a sick man who, after the beginning of a painful operation that could completely cure him, will not allow it to be completed, but prefers to retain his illness. Suffering approaches and, as such, offers the possibility of a denial of the will; but he rejects it by destroying the will’s phenomenon, the body, so that the will may remain unbroken. This is the reason why almost all ethical systems, philosophical as well as religious, condemn suicide, though they themselves cannot state anything but strange and sophistical arguments for so doing.",

The will itself cannot be abolished by anything except knowledge. Therefore the only path to salvation is that the will should appear freely and without hindrance, in order that it can recognize or know its own inner nature in this phenomenon. Only in consequence of this knowledge can the will abolish itself, and thus end the suffering that is inseparable from its phenomenon. This, however, is not possible through physical force, such as the destruction of the seed or germ, the killing of the new-born child, or suicide. Nature leads the will to the light, just because only in the light can it find its salvation.

A compromise with the anger of those directly injured by the criminal; an effort to localize the affair and to prevent it from causing any further, let alone a general, disturbance; attempts to discover equivalents and to settle the whole matter (compositio); above all, the increasingly definite will to treat every crime as in some sense dischargeable, and thus at least to a certain extent to isolate the criminal and his deed from one another—these traits become more and more clearly visible as the penal law evolves. As the power and self-confidence of a community increase, the penal law always becomes more moderate; every weakening or imperiling of the former brings with it a restoration of the harsher forms of the latter. The “creditor” always becomes more humane to the extent that he has grown richer; finally, how much injury he can endure without suffering from it becomes the actual measure of his wealth. It is not unthinkable that a society might attain such a consciousness of power that it could allow itself the noblest luxury possible to it—letting those who harm it go unpunished. “What are my parasites to me?” it might say. “May they live and prosper: I am strong enough for that!” The justice which began with, “everything is dischargeable, everything must be discharged ends by winking and letting those incapable of discharging their debt go free: it ends, as does every good thing on earth, by overcoming itself.1 This self-overcoming of justice: one knows the beautiful name it has given itself—mercy; it goes without saying that mercy remains the privilege of the most powerful man, or better, his—beyond the law.",

The most common form in which pleasure is thus prescribed as a curative is that of the pleasure of giving pleasure (doing good, giving, relieving, helping, encouraging, consoling, praising, rewarding); by prescribing “love of the neighbor,” the ascetic priest prescribes fundamentally an excitement of the strongest, most life-affirming drive, even if in the most cautious doses—namely, of the will to power. The happiness of “slight superiority,” involved in all doing good, being useful, helping, and rewarding, is the most effective means of consolation for the physiologically inhibited, and widely employed by them when they are well advised: otherwise they hurt one another, obedient, of course, to the same basic instinct.",

It was only in the hands of the priest, that artist in guilt feelings, that it achieved form—-oh, what a form! “Sin”—for this is the priestly name for the animal’s “bad conscience” (cruelty directed backward)—has been the greatest event so far in the history of the sick soul: we possess in it the most dangerous and fateful artifice of religious interpretation. Man, suffering from himself in some way or other but in any case physiologically like an animal shut up in a cage, uncertain why or wherefore, thirsting for reasons—reasons relieve—thirsting, too, for remedies and narcotics, at last takes counsel with one who knows hidden things, too—and behold! he receives a hint, he receives from his sorcerer, the ascetic priest, the first hint as to the “cause” of his suffering: he must seek it in himself, in some guilt, in a piece of the past, he must understand his suffering as a punishment. He has heard, he has understood, this unfortunate: from now on he is like a hen imprisoned by a chalk line. He can no longer get out of this chalk circle: the invalid has been transformed into “the sinner.”",

In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the command. That which is termed \"freedom of the will\" is essentially the emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: \"I am free, 'he' must obey\"—this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that \"this and nothing else is necessary now,\" the inward certainty that obedience will be rendered—and whatever else pertains to the position of the commander.

As regards a woman, for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for possession, sees the \"questionableness,\" the mere apparentness of such ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for his sake what she has or would like to have—only THEN does he look upon her as \"possessed.\" A third, however, has not even here got to the limit of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed, profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let himself be found out.

Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words \"good\" and \"stupid.\"—A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM, the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.—",

Danger, disquiet, anxiety attend the unknown – the first instinct is to eliminate these distressing states. First principle: any explanation is better than none. Because it is at bottom only a question of wanting to get rid of oppressive ideas, one is not exactly particular about what means one uses to get rid of them: the first idea which explains that the unknown is in fact the known does so much good that one ‘holds it for true’. Proof by pleasure (‘by potency’) as criterion of truth. – The cause-creating drive is thus conditioned and excited by the feeling of fear. The question ‘why?’ should furnish, if at all possible, not so much the cause for its own sake as a certain kind of cause – a soothing, liberating, alleviating cause. That something already known, experienced, inscribed in the memory is posited as cause is the first consequence of this need. The new, the unexperienced, the strange is excluded from being cause. – Thus there is sought not only some kind of explanation as cause, but a selected and preferred kind of explanation, the kind by means of which the feeling of the strange, new, unexperienced is most speedily and most frequently abolished – the most common explanations. – Consequence: a particular kind of cause-ascription comes to preponderate more and more, becomes concentrated into a system and finally comes to dominate over the rest, that is to say simply to exclude other causes and explanations. – The banker thinks at once of ‘business’, the Christian of ‘sin’, the girl of her love.",

One has to learn to see, one has to learn to think, one has to learn to speak and write: the end in all three is a noble culture. – Learning to see – habituating the eye to repose, to patience, to letting things come to it; learning to defer judgement, to investigate and comprehend the individual case in all its aspects. This is the first preliminary schooling in spirituality: not to react immediately to a stimulus, but to have the restraining, stock-taking instincts in one’s control. Learning to see, as I understand it, is almost what is called in unphilo-sophical language ‘strong will-power’: the essence of it is precisely not to ‘will’, the ability to defer decision. All unspir-ituality, all vulgarity, is due to the incapacity to resist a stimulus – one has to react, one obeys every impulse. In many instances, such a compulsion is already morbidity, decline, a symptom of exhaustion – almost everything which unphilosophical crudity designates by the name ‘vice’ is merely this physiological incapacity not to react – A practical application of having learned to see: one will have become slow, mistrustful, resistant as a learner in general. In an attitude of hostile calm one will allow the strange, the novel of every kind to approach one first – one will draw one’s hand back from it. To stand with all doors open, to prostrate oneself submissively before every petty fact, to be ever itching to mingle with, plunge into other people and other things, in short our celebrated modern ‘objectivity’, is bad taste, is ignoble par excellence. – 7 Learning to think: our schools no longer have any idea what this means. Even in our universities, even among students of philosophy themselves, the theory, the practice, the vocation of logic is beginning to die out. Read German books: no longer the remotest recollection that a technique, a plan of instruction, a will to mastery is required for thinking – that thinking has to be learned in the way dancing has to be learned, as a form of dancing.… Who among Germans still knows from experience that subtle thrill which the possession of intellectual light feet communicates to all the muscles! – A stiffly awkward air in intellectual matters, a clumsy hand in grasping – this is in so great a degree German that foreigners take it for the German nature in general. The German has no fingers for nuances.… That the Germans have so much as endured their philosophers, above all that most deformed conceptual cripple there has ever been, the great Kant, offers a good idea of German amenableness. For dancing in any form cannot be divorced from a noble education, being able to dance with the feet, with concepts, with words: do I still have to say that one has to be able to dance with the pen – that writing has to be learned? – But at this point I should become a complete enigma to German readers…",

They defined themselves counter to all those conditions under which a nation was previously able to live, was permitted to live; they made of themselves an antithesis to natural conditions – they inverted religion, religious worship, morality, history, psychology one after the other in an irreparable way into the contradiction of their natural values.",

Usually by force of arms, by toppling boundary markers, by violating pieties—but also by means of new religions and moralities. In every teacher and preacher of what is new we encounter the same “wickedness” that makes conquerors notorious, even if its expression is subtler and it does not immediately set the muscles in motion, and therefore also does not make one that notorious. What is new, however, is always evil, being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and the old pieties; and only what is old is good. The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts, digging deep and getting them to bear fruit—the farmers of the spirit. But eventually all land is exploited, and the ploughshare of evil must come again and again.",

If one considers that this means nothing less than excluding the whole world from a precious good, from happiness and enjoyment; if one considers that the lover aims at the impoverishment and deprivation of all competitors and would like to become the dragon guarding his golden hoard as the most inconsiderate and selfish of all “conquerors” and exploiters; if one considers, finally, that to the lover himself the whole rest of the world appears indifferent, pale, and worthless, and he is prepared to make any sacrifice, to disturb any order, to subordinate all other interests—then one comes to feel genuine amazement that this wild avarice and injustice of sexual love has been glorified and deified so much in all ages—indeed, that this love has furnished the concept of love as the opposite of egoism while it actually may be the most ingenuous expression of egoism.",

So far at least, culture that rests on a military basis still towers above all so-called industrial culture: the latter in its present shape is altogether the most vulgar form of existence that has yet existed. Here one is at the mercy of brute need; one wants to live and has to sell oneself, but one despises those who exploit this need and buy the worker. Oddly, submission to powerful, frightening, even terrible persons, like tyrants and generals, is not experienced as nearly so painful as is this submission to unknown and uninteresting persons, which is what all the luminaries of industry are. What the workers see in the employer is usually only a cunning, bloodsucking dog of a man who speculates on all misery; and the employer’s name, shape, manner, and reputation are a matter of complete indifference to them. The manufacturers and entrepreneurs of business probably have been too deficient so far in all those forms and signs of a higher race that alone make a person interesting. If the nobility of birth showed in their eyes and gestures, there might not be any socialism of the masses. For at bottom the masses are willing to submit to slavery of any kind, if only the higher-ups constantly legitimize themselves as higher, as born to command—by having noble manners. The most common man feels that nobility cannot be improvised and that one has to honor in it the fruit of long periods of time. But the lack of higher manners and the notorious vulgarity of manufacturers with their ruddy, fat hands give him the idea that it is only accident and luck that have elevated one person above another. Well, then, he reasons: let us try accident and luck! let us throw the dice! And thus socialism is born.",

Morality trains the individual to be a function of the herd and to ascribe value to himself only as a function.

Hence we should make a distinction in benevolence between the impulse to appropriate and the impulse to submit, and ask whether it is the stronger or the weaker that feels benevolent.

And what gives you the right to consider such a judgment true and infallible? For this faith—is there no conscience for that? Have you never heard of an intellectual conscience?64 A conscience behind your “conscience”? Your judgment “this is right” has a pre-history in your instincts, likes, dislikes, experiences, and lack of experiences. “How did it originate there?” you must ask, and then also: “What is it that impels me to listen to it?” You can listen to its commands like a good soldier who hears his officer’s command. Or like a woman who loves the man who commands. Or like a flatterer and coward who is afraid of the commander. Or like a dunderhead who obeys because no objection occurs to him. In short, there are a hundred ways in which you can listen to your conscience. But that you take this or that judgment for the voice of conscience—in other words, that you feel something to be right—may be due to the fact that you have never thought much about yourself and simply have accepted blindly that what you had been told ever since your childhood was right; or it may be due to the fact that what you call your duty has up to this point brought you sustenance and honors—and you consider it “right” because it appears to you as your own “condition of existence” (and that you have a right to existence seems irrefutable to you). For all that, the firmness of your moral judgment could be evidence of your personal abjectness, of impersonality; your “moral strength” might have its source in your stubbornness— or in your inability to envisage new ideals. And, briefly, if you had thought more subtly, observed better, and learned more, you certainly would not go on calling this “duty” of yours and this “conscience” of yours duty and conscience. Your understanding of the manner in which moral judgments have originated would spoil these grand words for you, just as other grand words, like “sin” and “salvation of the soul” and “redemption” have been spoiled for you.",

Constantly, some clamor or other calls us aside; rarely does our eye behold anything that does not require us to drop our own preoccupation instantly to help. I know, there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing my own way, and they are truly highly “moral”! Indeed, those who now preach the morality of pity even take the view that precisely this and only this is moral—to lose one’s own way in order to come to the assistance of a neighbor. I know just as certainly that I only need to expose myself to the sight of some genuine distress and I am lost. And if a suffering friend said to me, “Look, I am about to die; please promise me to die with me,” I should promise it; and the sight of a small mountain tribe fighting for its liberty would persuade me to offer it my hand and my life— if for good reasons I may choose for once two bad examples. All such arousing of pity and calling for help is secretly seductive, for our “own way” is too hard and demanding and too remote from the love and gratitude of others, and we do not really mind escaping from it—and from our very own conscience—to flee into the conscience of the others and into the lovely temple of the “religion of pity.” As soon as any war breaks out anywhere, there also breaks out precisely among the noblest people a pleasure that, to be sure, is kept secret: Rapturously, they throw themselves into the new danger of death because the sacrifice for the fatherland seems to them to offer the long desired permission—to dodge their goal; war offers them a detour to suicide, but a detour with a good conscience. And while I shall keep silent about some points, I do not want to remain silent about my morality which says to me: Live in seclusion so that you can live for yourself. Live in ignorance about what seems most important to your age. Between yourself and today lay the skin of at least three centuries. And the clamor of today, the noise of wars and revolutions should be a mere murmur for you. You will also wish to help—but only those whose distress you understand entirely because they share with you one suffering and one hope —your friends—and only in the manner in which you help yourself. I want to make them bolder, more persevering, simpler, gayer. I want to teach them what is understood by so few today, least of all by these preachers of pity: to share not suffering but joy.",

But what does unveil itself for us, unveils itself for us once only. The Greeks, to be sure, prayed: “Everything beautiful twice and even three times!” They implored the gods with good reason, for ungodly reality gives us the beautiful either not at all or once only. I mean to say that the world is overfull of beautiful things but nevertheless poor, very poor when it comes to beautiful moments and unveilings of these things.

He offered an exegesis, he read the highest meaning and value into it—and with this also the courage to despise every other way of life, the quiet Herrnhut46 fanaticism, the secret, subterranean self-confidence that grows and grows and finally is ready “to overcome the world” (that is, Rome and the upper classes throughout the Empire). Buddha likewise found a human type, in his case scattered through all classes and social strata of his people, that was good and good-natured from inertia (and above all inoffensive); also from inertia, this type lived abstinently, almost without needs. He understood how such a human type must inevitably roll, with its whole vis inertiae,47 into a faith that promises to prevent the recurrence of terrestrial troubles (meaning work and action in general). To understand that was his genius. To become the founder of a religion one must be psychologically infallible in one’s knowledge of a certain average type of souls who have not yet recognized that they belong together. It is he that brings them together. The founding of a religion therefore always becomes a long festival of recognition.",

I heard one of the common people say, “he knew me right away.”55 Then I asked myself: What is it that the common people take for knowledge? What do they want when they want “knowledge”? Nothing more than this: Something strange is to be reduced to something familiar.56 And we philosophers—have we really meant more than this when we have spoken of knowledge? What is familiar means what we are used to so that we no longer marvel at it, our everyday, some rule in which we are stuck, anything at all in which we feel at home. Look, isn’t our need for knowledge precisely this need for the familiar, the will to uncover under everything strange, unusual, and questionable something that no longer disturbs us? Is it not the instinct of fear that bids us to know? And is the jubilation of those who attain knowledge not the jubilation over the restoration of a sense of security? Here is a philosopher who fancied that the world was “known” when he had reduced it to the “idea.”57 Was it not because the “idea” was so familiar to him and he was so well used to it—because he hardly was afraid of the “idea” any more?",

I felt unsure (and sometimes still do) whether it is not only from this angle that one can get at the dangerous concept of the “artist”—a concept that has so far been treated with unpardonable generosity. Falseness with a good conscience; the delight in simulation exploding as a power that pushes aside one’s so-called “character,” flooding it and at times extinguishing it; the inner craving for a role and mask, for appearance; an excess of the capacity for all kinds of adaptations that can no longer be satisfied in the service of the most immediate and narrowest utility—all of this is perhaps not only peculiar to the actor? Such an instinct will have developed most easily in families of the lower classes who had to survive under changing pressures and coercions, in deep dependency, who had to cut their coat according to the cloth, always adapting themselves again to new circumstances, who always had to change their mien and posture, until they learned gradually to turn their coat with every wind and thus virtually to become a coat—and masters of the incorporated and inveterate art of eternally playing hide-and-seek, which in the case of animals is called mimicry—until eventually this capacity, accumulated from generation to generation, becomes domineering, unreasonable, and intractable, an instinct that learns to lord it over other instincts, and generates the actor, the “artist” (the zany, the teller of lies, the buffoon, fool, clown at first, as well as the classical servant, Gil Bias;91 for it is in such types that we find the pre-history of the artist and often enough even of the “genius”). In superior social conditions, too, a similar human type develops under similar pressures; only in such cases the histrionic instinct is usually barely kept under control by another instinct; for example, in the case of “diplomats.” Incidentally, I am inclined to believe that a good diplomat would always be free to become a good stage actor if he wished—if only he were “free.” As for the Jews, the people who possess the art of adaptability par excellence, this train of thought suggests immediately that one might see them virtually as a world-historical arrangement for the production of actors, a veritable breeding ground for actors. And it really is high time to ask: What good actor today is not—a Jew? The Jew as a born “man of letters,”92 as the true master of the European press, also exercises his power by virtue of his histrionic gifts; for the man of letters is essentially an actor: He plays the “expert,” the “specialist.” Finally, women. Reflect on the whole history of women: do they not have to be first of all and above all else actresses? Listen to physicians who have hypnotized women;93 finally, love them—let yourself be “hypnotized by them”! What is always the end result? That they “put on something” even when they take off everything.94 Woman is so artistic.",

        "content": "How each sex has its own prejudice about love — Despite all the concessions that I am willing to make to the prejudice in favor of monogamy, I will never admit the claim that man and woman have equal rights in love; these do not exist. For man and woman have different conceptions of love; and it is one of the conditions of love in both sexes that neither sex presupposes the same feeling and the same concept of “love” in the other. What woman means by love is clear enough: total devotion (not mere surrender98) with soul and body, without any consideration or reserve, rather with shame and horror at the thought of a devotion that might be subject to special clauses or conditions. In this absence of conditions her love is a faith; woman has no other faith. Man, when he loves a woman, wants precisely this love from her and is thus himself as far as can be from the presupposition of feminine love. Supposing, however, that there should also be men to whom the desire for total devotion is not alien; well, then they simply are—not men. A man who loves like a woman becomes a slave; while a woman who loves like a woman becomes a more perfect woman. A woman’s passion in its unconditional renunciation of rights of her own presupposes precisely that on the other side there is no equal pathos, no equal will to renunciation; for if both partners felt impelled by love to renounce themselves, we should then get—I do not know what; perhaps an empty space? Woman wants to be taken and accepted as a possession, wants to be absorbed into the concept of possession, possessed Consequently, she wants someone who takes, who does not give himself or give himself away; on the contrary, he is supposed to become richer in “himself”—through the accretion of strength, happiness, and faith given him by the woman who gives herself. Woman gives herself away, man acquires more—I do not see how one can get around this natural opposition by means of social contracts or with the best will in the world to be just, desirable as it may be not to remind oneself constantly how harsh, terrible, enigmatic, and immoral this antagonism is. For love, thought of in its entirety as great and full, is nature, and being nature it is in all eternity something “immoral.” Faithfulness is accordingly included in woman’s love; it follows from the definition. In man, it can easily develop in the wake of his love, perhaps as gratitude or as an idiosyncratic taste and so-called elective affinity; but it is not an essential element of his love—so definitely not that one might almost speak with some justification of a natural counterplay of love and faithfulness in man. For his love consists of wanting to have and not of renunciation and giving away; but wanting to have always comes to an end with having. It is actually man’s more refined and suspicious lust for possession that rarely admits his “having,” and then only late, and thus permits his love to persist. It is even possible for his love to increase after the surrender; he will not readily concede that a woman should have nothing more to give him.",

Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength. What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden. What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength. Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride? To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom? Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter? Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul? Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests? Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads? Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us? All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness. But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness. Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon. What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? “Thou-shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.” “Thou-shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold﻿—a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!” The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things﻿—glitter on me. “All values have already been created, and all created values﻿—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more.” Thus speaketh the dragon. My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent? To create new values﻿—that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating﻿—that can the might of the lion do. To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion. To assume the right to new values﻿—that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey. As its holiest, it once loved “Thou-shalt”: now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture. But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to become a child? Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: its own will, willeth now the spirit; his own world winneth the world’s outcast.

        "content": "Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus: “If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so. “But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it as it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands.” Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra answered: “Why art thou frightened on that account?﻿—But it is the same with man as with the tree. “The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep﻿—into the evil.” “Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that thou hast discovered my soul?” Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one will never discover, unless one first invent it.” “Yea, into the evil!” cried the youth once more. “Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me any longer; how doth that happen? “I change too quickly: my today refuteth my yesterday. I often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of the steps pardons me. “When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I seek on the height? “My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What doth he seek on the height? “How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How tired I am on the height!” Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus: “This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown up high above man and beast. “And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could understand it: so high hath it grown. “Now it waiteth and waiteth﻿—for what doth it wait? It dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps for the first lightning?”",

Verily, I may have done this and that for sufferers: but better things it seemed I always did when I learned to enjoy myself better. Ever since there have been human beings, they have enjoyed themselves too little: that alone, my brothers, is our original sin! And if we learn to enjoy ourselves better, so do we best unlearn our hurting of others and our planning hurts for them. Therefore I wash my hand if it has helped a sufferer; therefore I wipe my soul clean too. Having seen the sufferer suffer, I was ashamed on account of his shame; and when I helped him, then I sorely injured his pride. Acts of great kindness do not make people grateful, but rather vengeful; and if the small favour is not forgotten, it turns into a gnawing worm.* ‘Be reserved in accepting! Confer distinction when you accept!’– thus I counsel those who have nothing to bestow. But I myself am a bestower: I bestow gladly, as a friend to friends. But let strangers and the poor pluck the fruit from my tree themselves: that will make them less ashamed. Beggars, however, should be abolished altogether! Verily, it is annoying to give to them and annoying not to give to them. And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: pangs of conscience give people fangs. But the worst of all are petty thoughts. Verily, better even to have done something wicked than to have thought something petty!",

But this is my teaching: whoever wants to learn to fly must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance:– one cannot fly into flying! With rope-ladders I learned to climb up to many a window, with nimble legs I clambered up tall masts: to sit atop tall masts of understanding seemed no small bliss to me– – to flicker like small flames on tall masts: a small light, to be sure, and yet a great consolation for sea-driven sailors and castaways! By many different paths and ways have I come to my truth; not on one ladder alone have I climbed to the heights from which my eye roams into my distances. And only with reluctance did I ever ask the way– that always went against my taste! Rather I would question and try out the ways themselves. A trying and questioning was all my going: and verily, one must also learn how to answer such questioning! But this– is my taste: – not good, not bad, but my taste, about which I am no longer secretive or ashamed. ‘This– is just my way:– where is yours?’ Thus I answered those who asked of me ‘the way’. For the way– does not exist!",

My proof of this is, among other things, that I always instinctively chose the right means of dealing with unfavourable conditions: while the décadent as such always chooses the means that are harmful to him. As summa summarum* I was healthy, as nook, as speciality I was décadent. That energy to achieve absolute isolation and release from routine circumstances, the pressure on myself forcing me not to let myself be taken care of, waited on, doctored with any longer—they betray an absolute instinctual certainty about what, above all, was required at that stage. I took myself in hand, I made myself healthy again: the prerequisite for this—as every physiologist will concede—is that one is basically healthy. A typically morbid being cannot become healthy, still less make itself healthy; for a typical healthy person, conversely, being ill can even be an energetic stimulant to living, to living more. This, indeed, is how that long period of illness appears to me now: it was as if I discovered life anew, myself included; I tasted all the good things, even the small ones, as no other could easily taste them—I turned my will to health, to life, into my philosophy... For take note: the years when my vitality was at its lowest were when I stopped being a pessimist:* the instinct for self-recovery forbade me a philosophy of poverty and discouragement... And basically how do you tell if someone has turned out well!* By the fact that someone who has turned out well is good for our senses: the stuff he is made of is at once hard, delicate, and fragrant. Only what he finds conducive is to his taste; his pleasure, his enjoyment stops when the mark of what is conducive is overstepped. He guesses correctly what will heal harm, he exploits strokes of bad luck to his advantage; what does not kill him makes him stronger.* Instinctively he gathers together from everything he sees, hears, experiences, his aggregate: he is a selective principle, he lets a great deal go. He is always in his kind of company, whether he is dealing with books, people, or landscapes: he honours by choosing, by granting admission, by trusting. He reacts to every kind of stimulus slowly, with the slowness which years of caution and a willed pride have cultivated in him—he examines the stimulus as it approaches and has no intention of going to meet it. He does not believe in either ‘misfortune’ or ‘guilt’: he copes, with himself and with others, he knows how to forget —he is strong enough for everything to have to turn out for the best with him.—Well then, I am the opposite of a décadent: for I have just been describing myself.",

Being able to be an enemy, being an enemy—these require a strong nature, perhaps; in any case every strong nature presupposes them. It needs resistances, so it seeks resistance: aggressive pathos* is just as integrally necessary to strength as the feeling of revenge and reaction is to weakness. Woman, for instance, is vengeful:* that is a condition of her weakness, as is her sensitivity to other people’s afflictions.—The strength of an attacker can in a way be gauged by the opposition he requires; all growth makes itself manifest by searching out a more powerful opponent—or problem: for a philosopher who is warlike challenges problems to duels, too. The task is not to master all resistances, but only those against which one has to pit one’s entire strength, suppleness, and mastery-at-arms—opponents who are equal... Equality before the enemy—first precondition for an honest duel. If you despise, you cannot wage war; if you command, if you look down on something, you do not need to wage war.—My practice of war can be summed up in four propositions. First: I attack only causes that are victorious—on occasion, I wait till they are victorious. Second: I attack causes only when there are no allies to be found, when I am standing alone—when I am compromising myself alone... I have never made a move in public that was not compromising: this is my criterion for right action. Third: I never attack people—I make use of a person only as a kind of strong magnifying glass with which one can make visible some general but insidious and quite intangible exigency. This is how I attacked David Strauss,* or more precisely the success of a decrepit book among the ‘educated’ in Germany—I caught this education red-handed... This is how I attacked Wagner,* or more precisely the falsity, the instinctual indistinction of our ‘culture’, which mistakes the sophisticated for the rich, the late for the great. Fourth: I attack things only when all personal disagreement is ruled out, when there is no background of bad experiences. On the contrary, attacking is for me a proof of benevolence, even of gratitude. By linking my name with that of a cause or a person—whether for or against is indifferent to me—I honour them, I set them apart. When I wage war on Christianity, I am entitled to do so because I have not experienced any fatalities or hindrances from that quarter—the most earnest Christians have always been favourably disposed towards me. I myself, an opponent of Christianity de rigueur* have no intention of holding against an individual what has been the disaster of millennia. —",

Or the principle ‘happiness is virtue’s reward’... Or the principle ‘pleasure and displeasure are opposites’... The Circe* of humanity, morality, has falsified beyond recognition— infected —all psychologica* right down to that ghastly nonsense, that love should be something ‘unegoistic’... You have to be sure of yourself, you have to be standing bravely on your own two feet, otherwise you simply cannot love. The little women know that only too well, after all: they don’t give a damn about selfless, merely objective men... May I venture the supposition, by the by, that I know the little women? That is an aspect of my Dionysian dowry. Who knows? perhaps I am the foremost psychologist of the eternal feminine.* They all love me—an old story: excluding the botched little women, the ‘emancipated’ ones, who are incapable of producing children.—Fortunately I am not willing to let myself be torn apart: the perfect woman tears apart when she loves... I know these charming maenads*... Ah, what dangerous, insidious, subterranean little predators! And so pleasant with it!... A little woman running after her revenge would run down fate itself.— Woman is unutterably more wicked than man, and cleverer; goodness in a woman is already a form of degeneration... Deep down inside all so-called ‘beautiful souls’* there is a physiological illness—I shan’t say any more, to avoid becoming medicynical. The struggle for equal rights is even a symptom of illness: every doctor knows that.—The more womanly a woman is, the more she fights tooth and nail to defend herself against any kind of rights: the natural state, the eternal war between the sexes puts her in first place by a wide margin, after all.—Did anyone have ears for my definition of love? it is the only one worthy of a philosopher. Love—war in its means, at bottom the deadly hatred of the sexes.*—Did anyone hear my answer to the question of how you cure —‘redeem’—a woman? You get her pregnant. Woman needs children, man is always just a means: thus spoke Zarathustra.*—‘Emancipation of woman’—this is the instinctual hatred of the botched, i.e. infertile woman against the woman who turned out well—the struggle against ‘men’ is always just a means, a pretext, a tactic. By raising themselves up—as ‘woman in herself’, as ‘higher woman’, as ‘idealist’ of a woman*—they want to bring down the general level of woman’s standing; nothing is more guaranteed to achieve this than high-school education, trousers, and the right to vote like political cattle. The emancipated ones are basically the anarchists in the world of the ‘eternal feminine’, the ones who turned out badly, whose nethermost instinct is for revenge...",

On the one hand I am denying a type of human being who has hitherto been considered the highest type—the good, the benevolent, the beneficent; on the other hand I am denying a kind of morality that has achieved validity and predominance as morality in itself— décadence morality, or to put it more concretely, Christian morality. The second contradiction could be seen as the more decisive, since, broadly speaking, the overestimation of goodness and benevolence strikes me as already a consequence of décadence, as a symptom of weakness, as irreconcilable with an ascendant and yes-saying life: denying and destroying are the preconditions for yes-saying.—Let me stay for a moment with the psychology of the good man. In order to judge what a type of human being is worth, you have to calculate how much it costs to maintain it—you have to know its conditions of existence. The condition of existence of the good is lying — put differently, not wanting at any price to see how reality is constituted, which is not in a manner so as to challenge benevolent instincts at every turn, still less so as to permit the intrusion of short-sighted, good-natured hands at every turn. Considering emergencies of every kind as an objection, as something to be abolished, is niaiserie* par excellence, broadly speaking, a real disaster in its consequences, a destiny of stupidity—practically as stupid as the will to abolish bad weather—out of sympathy with the poor, perhaps... In the great economy of the whole the awfulness of reality (in the affects, in the desires, in the will to power) is incalculably more necessary than is that form of petty happiness, so-called ‘goodness’; indeed you have to be indulgent to even give it house-room, such is its instinctual hypocrisy. I shall have a great opportunity to demonstrate for the whole of history the exceptionally uncanny consequences of optimism, this monstrous product of the homines optimi.* Zarathustra, the first to understand that the optimist is just as much a décadent as the pessimist and possibly more noxious, says: good men never tell the truth. False coasts and securities the good have taught you; in the lies of the good you were born and bred. Everything has been lied about and twisted around down to its ground by the good* Fortunately the world is not constructed for the benefit of instincts, so that merely good-natured herd animals find their circumscribed happiness in it; demanding that everything should become ‘good man’, herd animal, blue-eyed, benevolent, ‘beautiful soul’—or, as Mr Herbert Spencer would have it, altruistic—would mean depriving existence of its great character, castrating humanity and reducing it to a wretched chinoiserie.—And this has been attempted!... This is precisely what people have called morality. .. It is in this sense that Zarathustra calls the good at times ‘the last men’, at times the ‘beginning of the end’; above all he senses they are the most harmful kind of human being, because they ply their existence both at the expense of the truth and at the expense of the future.",

For metaphysical views lead one to believe that they offer the conclusive foundation upon which all future generations are henceforth obliged to settle and build.

But whichever is the case, such a stance makes one an exception among men. Most men tolerate life without grumbling too much and believe thus in the value of existence, but precisely because everyone wills himself alone and stands his ground alone, and does not step out of himself as do those exceptional men, everything extrapersonal escapes his notice entirely, or seems at the most a faint shadow.

The old motives of intense desire would still be strong at first, due to old, inherited habit, but they would gradually grow weaker under the influence of cleansing knowledge. Finally one would live among men and with oneself as in nature, without praise, reproaches, overzealousness, delighting in many things as in a spectacle that one formerly had only to fear. One would be free of appearance 32 and would no longer feel the goading thought that one was not simply nature, or that one was more than nature. Of course, as I said, a good temperament would be necessary—a secure, mild, and basically cheerful soul; such a disposition would not need to be on guard for tricks and sudden explosions, and its expressions would have neither a growling tone nor sullenness—those familiar bothersome traits of old dogs and men who have lain a long time chained up. Rather, a man from whom the ordinary chains of life have fallen in such measure that he continues to live on only to better his knowledge must be able to renounce without envy and chagrin much, indeed almost everything, that other men value. He must be content with that free, fearless hovering over men, customs, laws and the traditional evaluations of things, which is for him the most desirable of states. He is glad to communicate his joy in this state, and perhaps he has nothing else to communicate, which is, to be sure, one renunciation, one self-denial the more.

At first we call particular acts good or evil without any consideration of their motives, but simply on the basis of their beneficial or harmful consequences. Soon, however, we forget the origin of these terms and imagine that the quality “good” or “evil” is inherent in the actions themselves, without consideration of their consequences; this is the same error language makes when calling the stone itself hard, the tree itself green—that is, we take the effect to be the cause. Then we assign the goodness or evil to the motives, and regard the acts themselves as morally ambiguous. We go even further and cease to give to the particular motive the predicate good or evil, but give it rather to the whole nature of a man; the motive grows out of him as a plant grows out of the earth. So we make man responsible in turn for the effects of his actions, then for his actions, then for his motives and finally for his nature. Ultimately we discover that his nature cannot be responsible either, in that it is itself an inevitable consequence, an outgrowth of the elements and influences of past and present things; that is, man cannot be made responsible for anything, neither for his nature, nor his motives, nor his actions, nor the effects of his actions. And thus we come to understand that the history of moral feelings is the history of an error, an error called “responsibility,” which in turn rests on an error called “freedom of the will.”",

The hypocrite who always plays one and the same role finally ceases to be a hypocrite. Priests, for example, who are usually conscious or unconscious hypocrites when they are young men, finally end by becoming natural, and then they really are priests, with no affectation. Or if the father does not get that far, perhaps the son, using his father’s headway, inherits the habit. If someone wants to seem to be something, stubbornly and for a long time, he eventually finds it hard to be anything else. The profession of almost every man, even the artist, begins with hypocrisy, as he imitates from the outside, copies what is effective. The man who always wears the mask of a friendly countenance eventually has to gain power over benevolent moods without which the expression of friendliness cannot be forced—and eventually then these moods gain power over him, and he is benevolent.",

The soldier wishes that he might fall on the battlefield for his victorious fatherland, for in the victory of his fatherland his greatest desire is also victorious. The mother gives the child what she takes from herself: sleep, the best food, in some instances even her health, her wealth. Are all these really selfless states, however? Are these acts of morality miracles because they are, to use Schopenhauer’s phrase, “impossible and yet real”? Isn’t it clear that, in all these cases, man is loving something of himself, a thought, a longing, an offspring, more than something else of himself; that he is thus dividing up his being and sacrificing one part for the other? Is it something essentially different when a pigheaded man says, “I would rather be shot at once than move an inch to get out of that man’s The inclination towards something (a wish, a drive, a longing) is present in all the above-mentioned cases; to yield to it, with all its consequences, is in any case not “selfless.” In morality, man treats himself not as an “individuum,” but as a “dividuum.”",

A still higher state is reached when man acts according to the principle of honor, by means of which he finds his place in society, submitting to commonly held feelings; that raises him high above the phase in which he is guided only by personal usefulness. Now he shows—and wants to be shown—respect; that is, he understands his advantage as dependent on his opinion of others and their opinion of him. Finally, at the highest stage of morality until now, he acts according to his standard of things and men; he himself determines for himself and others what is honorable, what is profitable. He has become the lawgiver of opinions, in accordance with the ever more refined concept of usefulness and honor.

Accordingly, custom is the union of the pleasant and the useful; in addition, it requires no thought. As soon as man can exercise force, he exercises it to introduce and enforce his mores, for to him they represent proven wisdom. Likewise, a community will force each individual in it to the same mores. Here is the error: because one feels good with one custom, or at least because he lives his life by means of it, this custom is necessary, for he holds it to be the only possibility by which one can feel good; the enjoyment of life seems to grow out of it alone. This idea of habit as a condition of existence is carried right into the smallest details of custom: since lower peoples and cultures have only very slight insight into the real causality, they make sure, with superstitious fear, that everything take the same course; even where a custom is difficult, harsh, burdensome, it is preserved because it seems to be highly useful. They do not know that the same degree of comfort can also exist with other customs and that even higher degrees of comfort can be attained.

The problem that those men set themselves is most closely related to this one: how can the weaker tribe nevertheless dictate laws to the stronger, direct it, and guide its actions (as they relate to the weaker tribe)? At first one will be reminded of the most harmless kind of pressure, that pressure one exerts when one has courted someone’s affections. By entreaties and prayers, by submissiveness, by committing oneself to regular tributes and gifts, by flattering glorifications, it is also possible to exert pressure on the forces of nature, by making them favorably inclined: love binds and is bound.

It is easy to see how men become worse by labeling the unavoidably natural as bad and later feeling it to be so constituted. It is the device of religion, and of those metaphysicians who want to think of man as evil and sinful by nature, to have him cast suspicion on nature and to make himself bad; for he learns thus to experience himself as bad, since he cannot take off the dress of nature. Gradually, after a long life of nature, he feels so oppressed by such a burden of sins that supernatural powers become necessary to lift this burden; and with that, the need for redemption, which we have already discussed, enters the scene, corresponding to no real sinfulness but rather only to an imagined one. If one goes through the individual moral statements of the documents of Christianity, one will find everywhere that the demands have been exaggerated so that man cannot satisfy them; the intention is not that he become more moral, but rather that he feel as sinful as possible. If man had not found this feeling agreeable, why should he have produced such an idea and been attached to it for so long? As in the ancient world an immeasurable strength of spirit and inventiveness was employed to increase joy in life through ceremonial worship, so in the age of Christianity an equally immeasurable amount of spirit has been offered up to a different striving: man was to feel sinful in all ways and excited, animated, inspired thereby.",

To call someone “divine” means “Here we do not have to compete.” Furthermore, everything that is complete and perfect is admired; everything evolving is underestimated. Now, no one can see in an artist’s work how it evolved: that is its advantage, for wherever we can see the evolution, we grow somewhat cooler. The complete art of representation wards off all thought of its evolution; it tyrannizes as present perfection.

But they acquired greatness, became “geniuses” (as we say) through qualities about whose lack no man aware of them likes to speak; all of them had that diligent seriousness of a craftsman, learning first to form the parts perfectly before daring to make a great whole. They took time for it, because they had more pleasure in making well something little or less important, than in the effect of a dazzling whole. For example, it is easy to prescribe how to become a good short story writer, but to do it presumes qualities which are habitually overlooked when one says, “I don’t have enough talent.” Let a person make a hundred or more drafts of short stories, none longer than two pages, yet each of a clarity such that each word in it is necessary; let him write down anecdotes each day until he learns how to find their most concise, effective form; let him be inexhaustible in collecting and depicting human types and characters; let him above all tell tales as often as possible, and listen to tales, with a sharp eye and ear for the effect on the audience; let him travel like a landscape painter and costume designer; let him excerpt from the various sciences everything that has an artistic effect if well portrayed; finally, let him contemplate the motives for human behavior, and disdain no hint of information about them, and be a collector of such things day and night. In this diverse exercise, let some ten years pass: and then what is created in the workshop may also be brought before the public eye. But how do most people do it? They begin not with the part but with the whole. Perhaps they once make a good choice, excite notice, and thereafter make ever worse choices for good, natural reasons. Sometimes when reason and character are lacking to plan this kind of artistic life, fate and necessity take over their function, and lead the future master step by step through all the requisites of his craft.",

In their case, good, sound custom strengthens them; they are taught to subordinate the individual, and their character is given solidity, at first innately and later through education. The danger in these strong communities, founded on similar, steadfast individual members, is an increasing, inherited stupidity, which follows all stability like a shadow. In such communities, spiritual progress depends on those individuals who are less bound, much less certain, and morally weaker; they are men who try new things, and many different things. Because of their weakness, countless such men are destroyed without having much visible effect; but in general, especially if they have descendants, they loosen things up, and, from time to time, deliver a wound to the stable element of a community. Precisely at this wounded, weakened place, the common body is inoculated, so to speak, with something new; however, the community’s overall strength, has to be great enough to take this new thing into its bloodstream and assimilate it. Wherever progress is to ensue, deviating natures are of greatest importance. Every progress of the whole must be preceded by a partial weakening.

In a warlike and restless clan, for example, the sicklier man may have occasion to be alone, and may therefore become quieter and wiser; the one-eyed man will have one eye the stronger; the blind man will see deeper inwardly, and certainly hear better. To this extent, the famous theory of the survival of the fittest1 does not seem to me to be the only viewpoint from which to explain the progress of strengthening of a man or of a race. Rather, two things must coincide: first of all, stable power must increase through minds bound in faith and communal feeling; and secondly, it must be possible to attain higher goals when degenerating natures partially weaken or wound the stable power; it is precisely the weaker nature, as the more delicate and free, that makes progress possible at all. If a people starts to crumble and grow weak at some one place, but is still strong and healthy in general, it can accept being infected with something new, and can incorporate it to its advantage. The task of education is to make the individual so firm and sure that, as a whole being, he can no longer be diverted from his path. But then the educator must wound him, or use the wounds that fate delivers; when pain and need have come about in this way, something new and noble can also be inoculated into the wounded places. His whole nature will take it in, and show the ennoblement later in its fruits.",

If someone acts from a few motives which are always the same, his actions take on great energy; if these actions are in harmony with the principles of bound spirits, they are acknowledged, and also produce in the one performing them the feeling of a good conscience. Few motives, energetic action, and a good conscience constitute what is called strength of character. The man of strong character lacks knowledge of the many possibilities and directions of action: his intellect is unfree, bound, because it shows him in any given case perhaps only two possibilities; between these he must necessarily choose, in accordance with his whole nature, and he does so easily and quickly because he doesn’t have to choose among fifty possibilities. The educating environment wants to make each man unfree by always presenting him with the smallest number of possibilities. His educators treat the individual as if he were something new, to be sure, but as if he ought to become a repetition. If man first appears to be something unknown, never before existing, he should be made into something known, preexisting. What is called good character in a child is the manifestation of its being bound by the preexisting.

It is the same with freedom of opinions as with health: both are individual; no generally valid concept can be set up about either.

But one must be able to look beyond them, outgrow them; if one stays under their spell, one does not understand them. Likewise, you must be familiar with history and the delicate game with the two scales: “on the one hand-on the other hand.” Stroll backwards, treading in the footprints in which humanity made its great and sorrowful passage through the desert of the past; then you have been instructed most surely about the places where all later humanity cannot or may not go again. And by wanting with all your strength to detect in advance how the knot of the future will be tied, your own life takes on the value of a tool and means to knowledge. You have it in your power to merge everything you have lived through-attempts, false starts, errors, delusions, passions, your love and your hope-into your goal, with nothing left over: you are to become an inevitable chain of culture-rings, and on the basis of this inevitability, to deduce the inevitable course of culture in general. When your sight has become good enough to see the bottom in the dark well of your being and knowing, you may also see in its mirror the distant constellations of future cultures. Do you think this kind of life with this kind of goal is too arduous, too bereft of all comforts? Then you have not yet learned that no honey is sweeter than that of knowledge, and that the hanging clouds of sadness must serve you as an udder, from which you will squeeze the milk to refresh yourself. Only when you are older will you perceive properly how you listened to the voice of nature, that nature which rules the whole world through pleasure. The same life that comes to a peak in old age also comes to a peak in wisdom, in that gentle sunshine of continual spiritual joyfulness; you encounter both old age and wisdom on one ridge of life-that is how nature wanted it. Then it is time, and no cause for anger that the fog of death is approaching. Towards the light-your last movement; a joyful shout of knowledge-your last sound.",

Women are often privately amazed at the great honor men pay to their hearts.

All these relationships are now being slightly transformed, under the influence of the prevailing constitutional form of government: they are becoming compromises.

It provides all the conditions to enable men, in a few generations, to move and even behave elegantly and beautifully: greater freedom of feeling, the absence of miserable pettiness, of degradation before one’s employers, of penny thrift. For a young man, precisely these negative advantages are the richest birthright of good fortune; a very poor man with a noble nature usually destroys himself: he does not advance and acquires nothing; his race is not viable. But one must also remember that the effects of wealth are almost the same if a man is permitted to consume three hundred talers a year, or thirty thousand: then we no longer find any substantial heightening of favorable conditions. But to have less, to beg as a boy, and to debase oneself, is terrible, though it may be the right point of departure for those who want to try their luck in the splendor of the courts, in submission to the mighty and influential, or for those who want to be heads of churches.

This is no less relevant because in a system of free enterprise chances are not equal, since such a system is necessarily based on private property and (though perhaps not with the same necessity) on inheritance, with the differences in opportunity which these create. There is, indeed, a strong case for reducing this inequality of opportunity as far as congenital differences permit and as it is possible to do so without destroying the impersonal character of the process by which everybody has to take his chance and no person’s view about what is right and desirable overrules that of others.",

But this necessarily involves a reduction of opportunities open to others. If the producer, be he entrepreneur or worker, is to be protected against underbidding by outsiders, it means that others who are worse off are precluded from sharing in the relatively greater prosperity of the controlled industries. Every restriction on the freedom of entry into a trade reduces the security of all those outside it. And, as the number of those whose income is secured in this manner increases, the field of alternative opportunities which are open to anyone who suffers a loss of income is restricted; and for those unfavorably affected by any change the chance of avoiding a fatal diminution of their income is correspondingly diminished. And if, as has become increasingly true, in each trade in which conditions improve, the members are allowed to exclude others in order to secure to themselves the full gain in the form of higher wages or profits, those in the trades where demand has fallen have nowhere to go, and every change becomes the cause of large unemployment. There can be little doubt that it is largely a consequence of the striving for security by these means in the last decades that unemployment and thus insecurity for large sections of the population has so much increased.",

The difference went much deeper than could be explained on that ground, and the peculiar attributes of German society existed no less in circles in which the properly military influence was negligible than in those in which it was strong. It was not so much that at almost all times a larger part of the German people was organized for war than was true in other countries, but that the same type of organization was employed for so many other purposes, which gave German society its peculiar character. It was that a larger part of the civil life of Germany than of any other country was deliberately organized from the top, that so large a proportion of her people did not regard themselves as independent but as appointed functionaries, which gave her social structure its peculiar character.

Sombart knew that the Germans were held in contempt by other people because they regard war as sacred—but he glories in it. To regard war as inhuman and senseless is a product of commercial views.

War is to Sombart the consummation of the heroic view of life, and the war against England is the war against the opposite ideal, the commercial ideal of individual freedom and of English comfort, which in his eyes finds its most contemptible expression in—the safety razors found in the English trenches.",

Their responsibility is not altered by the fact that their aim is not a totalitarian system but rather a sort of corporative society in which the organized industries would appear as semi-independent and self-governing “estates.” But they are as shortsighted as were their German colleagues in believing that they will be allowed not only to create but also for any length of time to run such a system. The decisions which the managers of such an organized industry would constantly have to make are not decisions which any society will long leave to private individuals. A state which allows such enormous aggregations of power to grow up cannot afford to let this power rest entirely in private control. Nor is the belief any less illusory that in such conditions the entrepreneurs will be long allowed to enjoy the favored position which in a competitive society is justified by the fact that, of the many who take the risks, only a few achieve the success the chances of which make the risk worth taking. It is not surprising that entrepreneurs should like to enjoy both the high income which in a competitive society the successful ones among them gain and the security of the civil servant. So long as a large sector of private industry exists side by side with the government-run industry, great industrial talent is likely to command high salaries even in fairly secure positions. But while the entrepreneurs may well see their expectations borne out during a transition stage, it will not be long before they will find, as their German colleagues did, that they are no longer masters but will in every respect have to be satisfied with whatever power and emoluments the government will concede them.",

And when your souls become great, they become exuberant, and in your sublimity there is wickedness. I know you well. In wickedness is the meeting of the exuberant man with the weakling. But they misunderstand each other. I know you well. You may only have enemies that are to be hated, but not enemies to be despised. You must be proud of your enemy: then the successes of your enemy are also your successes. Rebellion—that is nobility in the slave. May your nobility be obedience! May your very commanding be an obeying! To a good warrior, ‘Thou shalt’ sounds more pleasing than ‘I will’. And all that is dear to you, you should first let yourselves be commanded to do. May your love of life be love of your highest hope: and may your highest hope be the highest thought of life! But your highest thought you shall receive as a command from me—and it is this: the human is something that is to be overcome. So live your lives of obedience and of war! What use is living long! What warrior wants to be spared! I do not spare you; I love you from the ground up, my brothers in war!— Thus spoke Zarathustra.",

Freedom I love and the air over fresh earth; rather would I sleep on ox-hides than on their honours and respectabilities. I am too hot and burned by my own thoughts: often it almost takes my breath away. Then must I go out into the open and away from all dusty rooms. But they sit coolly in the cool shade: they want in all things to be mere spectators and are wary of sitting where the sun burns down upon the steps. Like those who stand in the street and gape at the people passing by, they too wait and gape at thoughts that others have thought. If one grasps them with one’s hands they give off a cloud of dust like sacks of flour, involuntarily: but who would guess that their dust comes from corn and from the yellow delight of summer fields? When they pose as wise, I am chilled by their little proverbs and truths: their wisdom often smells as if it came from the swamp; and verily, I have even heard a frog croaking in it! Skilful are they, with clever fingers: what does my simplicity want with their multiplicity! All kinds of threading and knotting and weaving their fingers understand: thus they work at the stockings of the spirit!* Fine clockworks are they: one must only take care to wind them up properly! Then they tell the hour without fail and make a modest noise besides. Like mills they work and like pounders: one has only to throw them some seed-corn!–they surely know how to grind corn small and make white dust out of it. They keep a sharp eye on each other and are not at all trustful. Inventive in petty craftiness, they wait for those whose knowing walks on lame feet–like spiders they wait. I have seen them always carefully preparing their poisons; and they always put on gloves of glass beforehand. They also know how to play with loaded dice; and I have found them playing so eagerly that they were sweating. We are alien to each other, and their virtues go even more against my taste than their falsehoods and loaded dice. And when I lived among them, I lived above them. Over that they became angry at me. They want to hear nothing of it when someone passes over their heads; and so they set up wood and earth and rubbish between me and their heads. Thus they muffled the sound of my steps: and so far I have been most poorly heard by the most scholarly ears. All human faults and weaknesses they set up between themselves and me:–‘false floors’ they call that in their houses. But notwithstanding I pass with my thoughts over their heads; and even if I wanted to walk on my own mistakes, I would still be above them and over their heads.

Here's how: as a consequence of their narrow-mindedness, they take the most immediate and secondary causes for the primary ones, and thus become convinced more quickly and easily than others that they have found an indisputable basis for their doings, and so they feel at ease; and that, after all, is the main thing. For in order to begin to act, one must first be completely at ease, so that no more doubts remain. Well, and how am I, for example, to set myself at ease? Where are the primary causes on which I can rest, where are my bases? Where am I going to get them? I exercise thinking, and, consequently, for me every primary cause immediately drags with it yet another, still more primary one, and so on ad infinitum. Such is precisely the essence of all consciousness and thought. So, once again it's the laws of nature. And what, finally, is the result? The same old thing. Remember: I was speaking just now about revenge. (You probably didn't grasp it.) I said: a man takes revenge because he finds justice in it. That means he has found a primary cause, a basis – namely, justice. So he is set at ease on all sides and, consequently, takes his revenge calmly and successfully, being convinced that he is doing an honest and just thing. Whereas I do not see any justice here, nor do I find any virtue in it, and, consequently, if I set about taking revenge, it will be solely out of wickedness. Wickedness could, of course, overcome everything, all my doubts, and thus could serve quite successfully in place of a primary cause, precisely in that it is not a cause.",

And so you just wave it aside, because you haven't found the primary cause. But try getting blindly carried away by your feelings, without reasoning, without a primary cause, driving consciousness away at least for a time; start hating, or fall in love, only so as not to sit with folded arms.

But of this I wish specially to say a couple of words myself. Can it be that he has such a love of destruction and chaos (it's indisputable that he sometimes loves them very much; that is a fact) because he is instinctively afraid of achieving the goal and completing the edifice he is creating? How do you know, maybe he likes the edifice only from far off, and by no means up close; maybe he only likes creating it, and not living in it, leaving it afterwards aux animaux domestiques,[19] such as ants, sheep, and so on and so forth. Now, ants have totally different tastes. They have a remarkable edifice of the same sort, forever indestructible – the anthill. With the anthill the most reverend ants began, and with the anthill they will doubtless end as well, which does great credit to their constancy and positiveness. But man is a frivolous and unseemly being, and perhaps, similar to a chess player, likes only the process of achieving the goal, but not the goal itself. And who knows (one cannot vouch for it), perhaps the whole goal mankind strives for on earth consists just in this cease-lessness of the process of achievement alone, that is to say, in life itself, and not essentially in the goal, which, of course, is bound to be nothing other than two times two is four – that is, a formula; and two times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death. At least man has always somehow feared this two times two is four, and I fear it even now. Suppose all man ever does is search for this two times two is four; he crosses oceans, he sacrifices his life in the search; but to search it out, actually to find it – by God, he's somehow afraid. For he senses that once he finds it, there will be nothing to search for. Workers, when they're done working, at least get their pay, go to a pot-house, then wind up with the police – so it keeps them busy for a week. But where is man to go? Something awkward, at any rate, can be noticed in him each time he achieves some such goal. Achieving he likes, but having achieved he does not quite like, and that, of course, is terribly funny. In short, man is comically arranged; there is apparently a joke in all this. But still, two times two is four is a most obnoxious thing. Two times two is four – why, in my opinion, it's sheer impudence, sirs. Two times two is four has a cocky look; it stands across your path, arms akimbo, and spits. I agree that two times two is four is an excellent thing; but if we're going to start praising everything, then two times two is five is sometimes also a most charming little thing.",

One can continue to build upon them—up to that final analysis, where the mistaken basic assumptions, those constant errors, come into contradiction with the results, for example, in atomic theory. There we still feel ourselves forced to assume a “thing” or a material “substratum” that is moved, while the entire scientific procedure has pursued the task of dissolving everything thing-like (material) into movements. Here, too, our feeling distinguishes that which is moving from that which is moved, and we do not come out of this circle, because the belief in things has been tied up with our essential nature from time immemorial.22 When Kant says “Reason does not create its laws from nature, but dictates them to her,”23 this is perfectly true in respect to the concept of nature which we are obliged to apply to her (Nature = world as idea, that is, as error), but which is the summation of a number of errors of reason. To a world that is not our idea, the laws of numbers are completely inapplicable: they are valid only in the human world.",

One level of education, itself a very high one, has been reached when man gets beyond superstitious and religious concepts and fears and, for example, no longer believes in the heavenly angels or original sin, and has stopped talking about the soul’s salvation. Once he is at this level of liberation, he must still make a last intense effort to overcome metaphysics. Then, however, a retrograde movement is necessary: he must understand both the historical and the psychological justification in metaphysical ideas. He must recognize how mankind’s greatest advancement came from them and how, if one did not take this retrograde step, one would rob himself of mankind’s finest accomplishments to date.",

Because in the first case, we assume necessity, and in the second a voluntarily governing free will. But this distinction is in error. Furthermore, even intentional injury is not called immoral in all circumstances: without hesitating, we intentionally kill a gnat, for example, simply because we do not like its buzz; we intentionally punish the criminal and do him harm, to protect ourselves and society. In the first case it is the individual who does harm intentionally, for self-preservation or simply to avoid discomfort; in the second case the state does the harm. All morality allows the intentional infliction of harm for self-defense; that is, when it is a matter of self-preservation! But these two points of view are sufficient to explain all evil acts which men practice against other men; man wants to get pleasure or resist unpleasure; in some sense it is always a matter of self-preservation. Socrates and Plato are right: whatever man does, he always acts for the good; that is, in a way that seems to him good (useful) according to the degree of his intellect, the prevailing measure of his rationality.",

Is the immoral thing about it, then, to have pleasure on the basis of other people’s unpleasure? Is Schadenfreude40 devilish, as Schopenhauer says?

Solely from the point of view of advantage, that is, from consideration of the consequences, of possible unpleasure, when the injured party or the state representing him leads us to expect requital and revenge; this alone can have been the original basis for denying oneself these actions. Pity does not aim at the pleasure of others any more than malice (as we said above) aims at the pain of others, per se. For in pity at least two (maybe many more) elements of personal pleasure are contained, and it is to that extent self-enjoyment: first of all, it is the pleasure of the emotion (the kind of pity we find in tragedy) and second, when it drives us to act, it is the pleasure of our satisfaction in the exercise of power.

The man who has fully understood the theory of complete irresponsibility can no longer include the so called justice that punishes and rewards within the concept of justice, if that consists in giving each his due. For the man who is punished does not deserve the punishment: he is only being used as the means to frighten others away from certain future actions; likewise, the man who is rewarded does not deserve this reward; he could not act other than as he did. Thus a reward means only an encouragement, for him and others, to provide a motive for subsequent actions: praise is shouted to the runner on the track not to the one who has reached the finish line. Neither punishment nor reward are due to anyone as his; they are given to him because it is useful, without his justly having any claims on them. One must say, “The wise man rewards not because men have acted rightly,” just as it was said, “The wise man punishes not because men have acted badly, but so they will not act badly.” If we were to dispense with punishment and reward, we would lose the strongest motives driving men away from certain actions and toward other actions; the advantage of man requires that they continue; and in that punishment and reward, blame and praise affect vanity most acutely, the same advantage also requires that vanity continue.",

It is like asking why God created mothers so that they must bear children in pain, nurse them and bring them up. Would it not have been simpler for God to give infants to mothers all fnished, without pangs of child-birth, without nursing, care and fear? No mother will ask this question, because she loves the child for the very pain it cost her, and the joy of her life is in nursing, raising and caring for it. Even so with human life: sins, errors, superstitions, the struggle with them and the overcoming of them,—therein is the meaning and the joy of human life.",

We cannot take the measure of another’s mind, even among our own flesh and blood. What is more, in reality one does not have mastery over even his own mind.

One wise man’s criticism should not be invited in order to please ten fools. Ten wise men should not be given offense in order to garner the adulation of a hundred fools. The criticism of fools is no cause for shame, the praise of fools no cause for joy. The censure or praise of fools is no criterion for any project. There is a story told about some later rulers, imitating the custom of drinking parties described in the Zhou Li, who now and then distributed free drink and food to the people.However, rulers cannot divine the true sentiments of the people by watching them enjoy themselves.Now, in a society which is moving towards civilization, anyone who enjoys doles of food and drink is either starving or a fool. And anyone who enjoys watching a fool enjoying himself is also a fool. Ancient history also tells the story of a ruler who traveled incognito among his people to learn about conditions in his land. He heard a plaintive children’s song and was deeply moved to compassion by it. What a roundabout way of doing things, this! Yet we have our modern counterparts: secret agents in the employ of dictatorial governments. Fearing those who would spread discontent among the people, a despotic government sends out its minions to sound out the temper of the people, with the idea of acting on their recommendations.Now, in the first place, what are the sources of information of their minions, the secret agents? The true gentleman has nothing to hide. But someone plotting subversive activity is usually too smart for secret agents and therefore evades their efforts to gain information. Thus the outcome is that the secret agents, paid to mix among the people, come into contact only with fools; they swallow what the latter have to say, throw in their own conjectures, and report this back to the ruler.Really, they are of no use whatsoever. They only cost their employer money and invite upon him the ridicule of intelligent people. In France Napoleon III employed secret agents for many years. For all his trouble, at the time of the Franco-Prussian War was he able to fathom the true sentiments of the people? And was he not captured when France was defeated?",

Without wisdom, private virtue and private knowledge cannot develop into their public counterparts, or the public and the private functionscan end up at oddswith and even harmful to each other. There has never before been a clear discussion of these four, but by examining the viewsof scholarsand what people commonly say one can see that they are aware of these distinctions. Menciusteachesthat there are “four beginnings” of virtue in the human heart: a sense of pity, a sense of shame and dislike concerning evil, a sense of modesty and deference to others, and a sense of right and wrong. These beginnings can expand indefinitely, just as fire, once lit, spreads furiously, and spring water, once it gushes forth, spills over in abundance. If these beginnings are brought to perfection, one can protect a whole country; if not, one cannot even care for one’sown parents. Menciusno doubt wasthinking of the idea that private virtue expands into public virtue. He also said that even if one has intelligence, one cannot do better than follow the trend of the times; even if one has all one’s farming tools ready, one had best wait for the right season.

Needless to say, the common people never asserted their own rights. Both religion and learning were under the control of the ruling class and never succeeded in becoming independent. Although in the wartime period the warriors seem to have been loyal and courageous, they never knew the taste of individuality. Whether in war or in peace, the whole fabric of social relationships, from the highest to the lowest, exhibited this imbalance of power. Like using a single medicine for ten thousand different illnesses, by the efficacy of this one medicine the power of the ruling class was augmented and centralized, and the rulers maintained authority in their own hands",

Thus in a sense it can be said that the second step regulates the first. For example, there is a saying that pain precedes pleasure, and another that good medicine is bitter to the taste. It is human nature to try to avoid what is painful and to dislike bitter medicine. When one focuses only on the first step, it is only natural to feel aversion to it. But when one sees the second step of pleasure and the cure of one’s illness, then the first step can be endured. Imbalance in power was also an unavoidable temporary measure to bolster the hearts of the people and attain proper order. It did not necessarily arise from evil intentions. It was the taking of the first step.However, even though this imbalance reached amazing heights of skill and perfection, when it finally came time to take the second step, the evil abuses of previous years came to light, to reveal the impossibility of drawing good from the first step. When youthink of it, the more skillful absolute government is, the greater are the resultant evils; and the longer a reign of peace, the deeper society’s ills.Eventually, a hereditary disease is handed on to future generations whose remedy is not easy to find.",

The weak and poor, in turn, may fawn on and deceive others. The ugly aspects of human life are certainly no different from what we find among Japanese. Sometimes they are even worse. But even with such social injustice there is still a pervading spirit of individuality and nothing hinders the expansion of the human spirit. Cruelty and arrogance are merely by-products of wealth and power and are not essential to them; flattery and deception are merely by-products of poverty and weakness and not to be feared. Neither might nor weakness is innate; they can be dealt with by means of human intelligence. If men have as their goal the handling of these problems by use of their intelligence, even if the solution actually lies beyond their control, they can still rely on their own powers and direct their own steps down the path of independent development, relying on their own efforts.

What must be especially feared in regard to economics is not a sword wound but something like tuberculosis, in which health deteriorates month by month, day by day. According to this idea, then, while the Japanese economy has not shown a gradual deterioration, the reason why it has always been the same̶or without ever becoming truly active in the past few hundred years̶is that, because of the imbalance of power, the accumulators and spenders of the national wealth have been cleanly divided, with no communication with each other. The failure to advance economically during the 250 years of Tokugawa rule was a case of “economic tuberculosis",

Why is it that these countries’ citizens take pride in themselves, and that other countries’ citizens envy them and strive so mightily to emulate their wealth and military power? Such things may run counter to the aims of religion, but power and wealth are essential in today’s world. The people of one nation, in their private relationships, may be able to befriend people of other countries far away and treat them as old friends, but when it comes to relations between one country and another only two things count: in times of peace, exchange goods and compete with one another for profit; in times of war, take up arms and kill each other. To put it another way, the present world is a world of commerce and warfare. Of course, there are many types of war too̶there are even wars for the sake of ending wars.Trade, too, being a reciprocal exchange based upon the principle of supplying each other’s needs, was a most fair occupation originally. Thus neither can be called bad by nature.However, a closer look at the conditions of war and trade in all countries in the world shows that neither of them could ever be considered to be based on the lofty religious teaching of “love thine enemy. ”",

For while trade is competitive, it is not engaged in solely on the basis of brute force but is an occupation that certainly requires intelligence. One must give credit for this to people today.Furthermore, if a nation attempts to trade with others, it must labor diligently to improve itself. Hence commercial prosperity can even be called a sign of national prosperity, for it makes people intellectually diligent within the nation, and their success in book learning and arts sheds a luster that reaches out to other nations. This is also true of war. If simply the art of killing people, it would be a hateful thing.However, if there were a nation that wanted suddenly to unleash its troops without a cause, even in the present imperfect state of civilization there are the express provisions of treaties, diplomatic negotiations, international law, and the criticism of scholars, so that such a nation could not easily get away with such lawless conduct.Moreover, alongside wars fought for the sake of profit are those fought for the honor of a nation and even those undertaken for the sake of justice.Therefore, while killing people and competing for profit are counter to religion’s aims and are the enemy of religion, still it must be conceded that they are unavoidable in the present state of civilization.

Clever people may learn the results of science as much as they like, one still sees from their conversation, especially from their hypotheses in conversation, that they lack the scientific spirit. They do not have that instinctive mistrust of the wrong ways of thinking, a mistrust which, as a consequence of long practice, has put its roots deep into the soul of every scientific man. For them it is enough to find any one hypothesis about a matter; then they get fired up about it and think that puts an end to it. For them, to have an opinion means to get fanatical about it and cherish it in their hearts henceforth as a conviction. If a matter is unexplained, they become excited at the first notion resembling an explanation that enters their brain; this always has the worst consequences, especially in the realm of politics. Therefore everyone should have come to know at least one science in its essentials; then he knows what method is, and how necessary is the most extreme circumspection. This advice should be given to women particularly, who are now the hopeless victims of all hypotheses, especially those which give the impression of being witty, thrilling, invigorating, or energizing.",

These norms motivate individuals to closely monitor themselves and members of their own group to make sure that everyone stays in line. They also often endow elders with substantial authority over junior members. Successfully navigating these kinds of social environments favors conformity to peers, deference to traditional authorities, sensitivity to shame, and an orientation toward the collective (e.g., the clan) over oneself. By contrast, when relational bonds are fewer and weaker, individuals need to forge mutually beneficial relationships, often with strangers. To accomplish this, they must distinguish themselves from the crowd by cultivating their own distinct set of attributes, achievements, and dispositions. Success in these individual-centered worlds favors the cultivation of greater independence, less deference to authority, more guilt, and more concern with personal achievement.",

For example, you’d never interfere if you saw one stranger stealing from a different stranger—for all you know, it’s payback for a prior affront between families. By contrast, in societies with weak family ties, seeking revenge is frowned upon and certainly not a source of honor or status. However, people think it’s appropriate, or even admirable, to trip a purse snatcher fleeing from the police, or to physically constrain an unknown husband from beating his wife.

What might be more surprising is that the evolved psychological push toward polygynous marriage doesn’t come just from men. Because women reproduce “in serial,” having and investing in only one baby (usually) at a time, their selection of a really good mate can be crucial. Not only do their chosen mates supply half of their children’s genes, but they may also provide protection, resources (e.g., meat, animal skins, flint, etc.), and other investments, such as teaching. In a world with polygynous marriage, young women and their families get a much larger selection of potential husbands to choose from than are available in a purely monogamous society; they can select either a married or an unmarried man. The best move for a particular woman in a hunter-gatherer society might be to become the second wife of a great hunter instead of being the first wife of a poor hunter; this helps guarantee that children get both excellent genes and a steady supply of meat (a valuable source of nutrition). Moreover, by joining a polygynous household, a woman might learn from her older co-wives, share resources like tools, honey, and cooking fires, and get help with babysitting or even nursing. Of course, in a perfect world, such a woman might prefer an exclusive arrangement with the great hunter; but, faced with the real-world choice between marrying polygynously for a better overall deal with the prestigious guy or marrying monogamously for a worse deal, she’ll often prefer to marry a married man. Thus monogamous norms constrain women’s choices as well as men’s and can prevent people from marrying whom they really want.",

The kindness and generosity found in many small-scale societies and rural villages where I’ve lived and worked are rooted in intensive kin-based institutions that focus on nurturing and sustaining enduring webs of interpersonal relationships. It’s both impressive and beautiful, but this interpersonal prosociality is about relationship-specific kindness, warmth, reciprocity, and—sometimes—unconditional generosity as well as authority and deference. It’s focused on the in-group members and their networks. If you’re in the group or the network, it can feel like a long and comforting hug. By contrast, economic experiments typically tap market norms that prescribe fair dealing and honesty with strangers or anonymous others, especially in monetary transactions. This impersonal prosociality is about fairness principles, impartiality, honesty, and conditional cooperation in situations and contexts where interpersonal connections and in-group membership are deemed unnecessary or even irrelevant.

        "content": "To understand why war evokes these effects on human psychology, let’s recall some of the ideas developed in Chapters 2 to 4. With the emergence of cultural evolution in the last two million years, competition among bands, clans, and tribes drove the cultural spread of cooperative social norms that permitted groups to survive both violent conflicts with other groups and natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, droughts, and volcanic eruptions. Among the norms and beliefs favored by this cultural evolutionary process, we’ve seen examples related to food sharing, communal rituals, and incest taboos. Such norms, along with those concerning mutual aid and communal defense, enmesh individuals in a dense social network that they depend on to survive. Adapting to this ancestral world has left our species with a genetically evolved response to war and other shocks that likely operates in at least three ways. First, shocks spark our interdependence psychology, causing us to invest more heavily in the social ties and communities that we rely on. In the case of war, this depends on who the “us” is that’s being attacked. If people perceive that “Ilahita” is being attacked, then they bond more tightly with their fellow villagers and expect others to do the same. For those lacking strong interpersonal networks, shocks will propel them to seek out and invest in new relationships and communities. Second, because social norms have culturally evolved to promote group survival, war and other shocks may psychologically strengthen our commitment to these norms and related beliefs. So, to the degree that social norms prescribe various forms of cooperation, people will become more cooperative along normative lines and more willing to punish deviations from these standards. These two psychological influences—solidifying interdependent groups and strengthening norms—combine with other aspects of our psychology to create the third effect: wars, earthquakes, and other disasters increase people’s religious commitments and ritual participation, resulting in the growth of religious groups.",

        "content": "First, by strengthening our social norms and related beliefs, wars and other shocks may directly deepen people’s faith and related commitments, which can inspire greater engagement in religious groups. Second, by stoking our interdependence psychology, shocks like war motivate people to either further invest in, or join, supportive communities. Because religious groups frequently offer mutual aid and support, this effect tends to increase participation in these groups. Greater investment in such groups often results in better attendance at church or the mosque, which can further strengthen supernatural beliefs (as a side effect). In addition to these effects, religions that promise people life after death and possess repetitive rituals that help individuals manage anxiety may get an especially big boost from the existential threats created by war and other disasters. People will be more attracted to religious groups and less likely to leave them compared to nonreligious communities. This suggests that some religious groups offer a trifecta: (1) interdependent networks that provide mutual aid, (2) shared commitments to sacred norms, and (3) rituals and supernatural beliefs that help manage existential anxiety and uncertainty. In a world filled with war and other disasters, intergroup competition favors the spread of religious packages that furnish this trifecta because these religions will win in competition with groups lacking these crucial qualities (not because these religions are “true”).7 Indeed, there’s now ample evidence that both natural disasters and war deepen people’s religious commitments and ritual participation. By combining global data on the historical intensity of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tropical storms with detailed surveys on religious beliefs from over a quarter of a million individuals in 90 or more countries, the economist Jeanet Bentzen has shown that people living in regions more prone to disasters are more religious, and that specifically they believe more strongly in god as well as heaven, hell, sin, and the devil.",

If this somehow didn’t happen over decades, it would certainly happen over generations. However, faced with competitors and well-functioning democratic institutions, political parties must vie for members and votes. As long as individuals can switch their parties or their votes, the competition among parties will tend to spread practices, beliefs, and values that promote a party’s success in attracting members and votes. Of course, in no way does this guarantee a healthy political system; but, it at least inhibits the otherwise inevitable slide into despotism, polarization, and dysfunction.",

And even when they can join such associations, their social ties, motivations, moral commitments, and ways of seeing the world still tend to keep them anchored in their inherited, kin-based communities and relational networks. Of course, kin-based groups or inherited communities can benignly compete, but members can’t “switch teams” or easily recruit new members if they want to. So, competition among such groups might only further accentuate their divisions, by more tightly binding people to their clans and regulated-relational norms. In this situation, intergroup competition could lower impersonal trust instead of raising it.",

        "content": "In the social sphere, the development of team sports and sports leagues placed nonviolent intergroup competition at the center of people’s leisure time, where it often became part of their personal identity. Participation in team sports became central to raising children (well, at least boys). After defeating Napoleon at Waterloo, the Duke of Wellington explained that the “battle was won on the playing fields of Eton,” by which he meant that the character of British officers was honed on the anvil of sport. Interestingly, cricket, rugby, hockey, soccer (football), American football, and baseball all trace their roots back to preindustrial England. The latter two American sports derive, respectively, from rugby and English folk games, including the children’s game of rounders and stoolball. Of course, today, Matsigenka enjoy soccer, Fijians rugby, Japanese baseball, and Indians cricket.54 My point is that our modern institutional frameworks incorporate various forms of intergroup competition that drive up people’s inclinations to trust and cooperate with strangers and may influence other aspects of our psychology. People learn to work in ad hoc teams, even if those teams are composed of a bunch of strangers. The engine of intergroup competition pushes against the within-group forces of cultural evolution, which often favor self-interest, zero-sum thinking, collusion, and nepotism. Our WEIRD institutional frameworks began developing during the High Middle Ages, as people who were increasingly individualistic, independent, nonconformist, and analytic started assorting themselves into voluntary associations, which in turn began to compete. In the long run, competition among territorial states favored those that developed ways to harness and embed the psychological and economic effects of nonviolent intergroup competition. Of course, no one designed this system, and few even realize how it shapes our psychology or why it often works.",

The historical data suggest that although some folks were certainly working to survive, many were working longer hours so that they could buy more stuff from Europe’s swelling streams of commercial goods. For the kitchen alone, Londoners could purchase tea, sugar, coffee, pepper, cod, nutmeg, potatoes, and rum. Pocket watches and pendulum clocks appeared in the 16th century and eventually became hot sellers. Literate folks could buy a range of printed books and pamphlets. People wanted all this for the stuff itself, of course, but also because of what it told others about them. In an individualistic world, what you buy tells people about what you can afford as well as what you value. From Bibles to pocket watches, people wanted to tell strangers and neighbors about themselves through their purchases. This, de Vries argues, drove up consumers’ desire for diverse goods and their willingness to work longer; stronger demand and more industrious workers drove up both economic production and consumer supply.",

To understand this, we need to consider both how certain proto-WEIRD psychological traits would have contributed to individual inventiveness and how the new economic and social conditions would have further bolstered these traits in an autocatalytic interaction. First, recall some of the psychological traits we’ve already discussed: patience, hard work, and analytical thinking. Following Edison’s observation that invention (or “genius”) is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration, it seems likely that as individuals became more industrious and patient, their chances of producing a successful invention would have risen. Moreover, the ongoing shift toward greater analytical thinking may have spurred innovation in several ways, including through a greater interest in experimentation, more faith in the existence of universal laws, and stronger inclinations to classify and categorize the world in context-free ways (into, e.g., species, elements, diseases, etc.).",

Let it go in one ear and out the other and settle some place else. Listen and say nothing, that’s the best thing to do,” according to Edward.

        "content": "It is said that great men often compartmentalize.4 They are able to separate their emotions, their inner and outer lives, freeing their drive for greatness from the limiting demands of family life and ordinary human wants and needs. Nixon certainly tried to separate his political or presidential being from his needier self. In his written communications and even verbally (“You won’t have Nixon to kick around anymore”), he would refer to a third-person Nixon—an almost disembodied “RN” or just “the President.” To his detractors, of course, he was Tricky Dick, the deceiver, the malign faker. Nixon could be heedless about the truth, and he was, like most successful public figures, an actor who presented an idealized version of himself. But he was a very good actor. To a remarkable degree, he succeeded at inventing a true World Leader, able to take his place on the global stage alongside some formidable personages. So personally ill at ease that he could not look his doctor in the eye,5 he was perfectly confident in the presence of historical figures from de Gaulle to Mao. How, an insightful Nixon observer once asked me, could you say he was insecure when these powerful men regarded him with such respect?6 Nixon often played the role of RN with skill and courage. But he failed to realize that separating RN, the cool hand at global poker, from the vulnerability and yearning of Richard, the desperate-to-please child of Frank and Hannah, was impossible. Nixon’s effort to rise above or separate from his neediness was admirable in some ways, but it was also self-deceiving and, in the end, self-destructive. If he had been more self-aware—if he had not pretended so much, tried so hard to be someone he was not—he could have watched for and compensated for his weaknesses, channeled his emotions without succumbing to their excesses.",

But by intelligence and grit, he accomplished great feats for his country and himself, not the least of which was getting elected, sometimes by overwhelming majorities, when he had to brace himself just to make small talk. He may have lacked self-knowledge, but he knew this: that he could be beaten down, counted out, and yet—always and no matter what the obstacles—rise again. It is one of the mysteries—and glories—of human nature that sinners can become saints. But only in prayers of another world are saints truly cleansed of sin. Often the most convincing moralists are the very ones who feel the temptation to sin most strongly. Some turn out to be hypocrites, but that does not mean their sermons are hollow. Very few, if any, great men or women are pure of heart, but inner torment and even a touch of wickedness can be catalysts to greatness. Nixon was no saint. But the fears and insecurities that led him into sinfulness also gave him the drive to push past self-doubt, to pretend to be cheerful, to dare to be brave, to see, often though sadly not always, the light in the dark.",

At the societal level, problems arise when the most viable, or only, road to higher status (and mating) demands that status seekers lie, cheat, steal, and kill to get up the ladder.38 The problem with laboratory findings like these is that they don’t tell us if such effects cash out in the real world.

Second, by stoking our interdependence psychology, shocks like war motivate people to either further invest in, or join, supportive communities. Because religious groups frequently offer mutual aid and support, this effect tends to increase participation in these groups. Greater investment in such groups often results in better attendance at church or the mosque, which can further strengthen supernatural beliefs (as a side effect). In addition to these effects, religions that promise people life after death and possess repetitive rituals that help individuals manage anxiety may get an especially big boost from the existential threats created by war and other disasters. People will be more attracted to religious groups and less likely to leave them compared to nonreligious communities. This suggests that some religious groups offer a trifecta: (1) interdependent networks that provide mutual aid, (2) shared commitments to sacred norms, and (3) rituals and supernatural beliefs that help manage existential anxiety and uncertainty. In a world filled with war and other disasters, intergroup competition favors the spread of religious packages that furnish this trifecta because these religions will win in competition with groups lacking these crucial qualities (not because these religions are “true”).7 Indeed, there’s now ample evidence that both natural disasters and war deepen people’s religious commitments and ritual participation.

Let it go in one ear and out the other and settle some place else. Listen and say nothing, that’s the best thing to do,” according to Edward. She compared anger and the desire for revenge to a spring flower that would die out. “Never say, ‘I hate,’ ” said Grandmother Milhous. “Don’t call anyone a liar. You’re not sure and if you are sure why advertise it? Let the lie die. Use silence.”57 Nixon was more heedful of a verse from a Longfellow poem she sent him: The heights of great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night.58",

It was normal to him, even necessary. And politics, he knew, was something at which he could succeed. He may have lacked the natural gifts of the smooth sophisticates, the Bob Logues and the Franklins, but by dint of shrewdness and hard work, he could work around, compensate, overcome. Ever alert to slights himself, he could read people and situations; he knew what made people fearful and hopeful and how to sense what they wanted, even if they didn’t quite know it themselves. He could identify and empathize with the lonely and left behind. As if to defy his own shyness, he liked to be on stage; he had a prodigious memory; he didn’t mind pressing the flesh. Indeed, he seemed to welcome plunging into crowds. As a student leader, he had developed a taste for power, the getting and using of it. Quite possibly, in the validation of elected office, he found a replacement for the adoration he missed as a child, which even Pat could not replace. Heeding his grandmother Milhous, he wanted to make his mark by doing good in the world, to leave “footprints in the sands of time.”",

There was no attempt at self-analysis, as there might have been by a member of a later generation; surely, he did not see what some future biographers would discern—a frightened boy cowering before his father’s hand or an over-eager youngster desperately seeking to win his withholding mother’s conditional love.30 Rather, he saw a fighter, a battler. Sleeplessness and short temper were not signs of neurosis or even “jitteryness.” They were, for Nixon, the predictable manifestations of the “mind, emotions, and body” bracing for noble combat. What Nixon really felt, deep down, is unknowable, but no one ever worked harder at maintaining a facade of upbeat stoicism, not just to the outside world, one suspects, but in his own mind as well. He was determined not to worry about being worried. He was not insensitive. He was not a blunt instrument, a “planing machine gouging a deep self-beneficial groove through life,” as William James had described Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Indeed, despite his later jealousy, he had been able to see past JFK’s show of effortless grace to a kindred shyness. Nixon felt that he had overcome his disadvantages not by giving in but by fighting back—by audacity and grit, not equivocation and self-doubt. He rarely lowered his guard or stood down.",

Nixon certainly tried to separate his political or presidential being from his needier self. In his written communications and even verbally (“You won’t have Nixon to kick around anymore”), he would refer to a third-person Nixon—an almost disembodied “RN” or just “the President.” To his detractors, of course, he was Tricky Dick, the deceiver, the malign faker. Nixon could be heedless about the truth, and he was, like most successful public figures, an actor who presented an idealized version of himself. But he was a very good actor. To a remarkable degree, he succeeded at inventing a true World Leader, able to take his place on the global stage alongside some formidable personages. So personally ill at ease that he could not look his doctor in the eye,5 he was perfectly confident in the presence of historical figures from de Gaulle to Mao. How, an insightful Nixon observer once asked me, could you say he was insecure when these powerful men regarded him with such respect?6 Nixon often played the role of RN with skill and courage. But he failed to realize that separating RN, the cool hand at global poker, from the vulnerability and yearning of Richard, the desperate-to-please child of Frank and Hannah, was impossible. Nixon’s effort to rise above or separate from his neediness was admirable in some ways, but it was also self-deceiving and, in the end, self-destructive. If he had been more self-aware—if he had not pretended so much, tried so hard to be someone he was not—he could have watched for and compensated for his weaknesses, channeled his emotions without succumbing to their excesses.",

He may have lacked self-knowledge, but he knew this: that he could be beaten down, counted out, and yet—always and no matter what the obstacles—rise again. It is one of the mysteries—and glories—of human nature that sinners can become saints. But only in prayers of another world are saints truly cleansed of sin. Often the most convincing moralists are the very ones who feel the temptation to sin most strongly. Some turn out to be hypocrites, but that does not mean their sermons are hollow. Very few, if any, great men or women are pure of heart, but inner torment and even a touch of wickedness can be catalysts to greatness. Nixon was no saint. But the fears and insecurities that led him into sinfulness also gave him the drive to push past self-doubt, to pretend to be cheerful, to dare to be brave, to see, often though sadly not always, the light in the dark.",

Second, by stoking our interdependence psychology, shocks like war motivate people to either further invest in, or join, supportive communities. Because religious groups frequently offer mutual aid and support, this effect tends to increase participation in these groups. Greater investment in such groups often results in better attendance at church or the mosque, which can further strengthen supernatural beliefs (as a side effect). In addition to these effects, religions that promise people life after death and possess repetitive rituals that help individuals manage anxiety may get an especially big boost from the existential threats created by war and other disasters. People will be more attracted to religious groups and less likely to leave them compared to nonreligious communities.
